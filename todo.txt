fix the incessant git pull thing

add a last "updated" thing in the catalog (with date + commit name)

add log (or docker thing?) to get notified when the app is killed

include all the commits we missed in the commits tbl

add a rule somewhere to forbid '?' in filenames, because this is buggy on
windows.

* Sort out languages tagging
* Fix logic in parse.py, use decorators for handlers and see how XSLT
  does things.
* Physical display. Keep [****], but in logical use the convention
  described in editorial
* In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages
* Les espaces _ et <space/> à afficher seulement en physical
* Fix formatting of page nmbers in biblio, missing "p.~"

INSTamilNadu00102: look at <l> within the large <lg>; number 5,10,15; avec des

===========================================================

add a side menu for navigating inscriptions. on mobile, make it collapse. the
toggle button should be on the menu bar, to save space.
even on pc, must have a button to hide/show it. also must be possible to
redimension it.
XXX the menu on the left is not really sticky.

   Metadata
   Edition
   Apparatus?
   Translation*
   Commentary?
   Bibliography?
   Notes?
   XML source

for the catalog, we'll also need a sidebar.

--------------------------------------------------------

check that the new change.py works

---------------------------------------------------------global

make a list of common errors + suggestions about the current egd

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

* EGD annex B on meters for auto recognition of meters ; which one?
* plain texts for in a month

-----------------------------------------------------------dominic

dicts:
* add nws.uzi.uni-halle.de ; juste la colonne de gauche.
* add the (incomplete) one from pune "an encyclopedic ... on historical principals"; available
  on; on koeln + from peter scharf?

------------------------------------------------------------------

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

XXX make sure we complain when file names are not unique across all repos
