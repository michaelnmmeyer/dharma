Add something to rebuild the database and deploy automatically when we make changes to the
schema and that restarts the server and changepy.

deal with this:https://github.com/erc-dharma/project-documentation/issues/269

in server add stuff to ensure we don't try to access repos/, all accesses to
repos should go through the db. could also run the process without write perms
to repos or sth, but probably not feasible without patching python's binary or
creating users, etc. in fact, we only need access to /views and /static, and we
shouldn't use immediate opens. use:

  fetch_file_from_fs(repo, name)
  fetch_file_from_db(repo, name)

would be convenient to have position-independent files, viz. assume file
basenames are unique AND also extension-independent files to allow people to
move files around.

should always show the most recent file when we have duplicates. and add an error message on the displayed inscriptions that tells the file is not unique and that provides a way to
see the other files.

deal with rendition and xml:lang, which must cover the whole text in div type edition.

=====


maybe just patch the open func as a primary check to verify that we don't
open files for no reason? not sufficient, plenty of ways we might access the fs.

for https://github.com/erc-dharma/project-documentation/issues/266#issue-2207593274

don't use href in in-page links, it's confusing; use data-href instead; and this
would allow us to distinguish page-internal links from the others.

Should also store a local copy of files we fetch from web



update popperjs
read the tuto. figure out how to reprod tooltip functionality.

XXX find some way to report non unique files ; could use an intermediate table
that stores duplicates, like for zotero; for duplicate files in the same repo,
we are sure there is a problem and we can complain early on while processing the
repo itself (to whom, however?); but if the files are in distinct repos, we
cannot tell whether the file is being moved or anything, because there is no
global commit across all repos and the order of operations is not guaranteed.

in any case, we must preserve the fact that a given ident always corresponds to
exactly one elem; so if we have a duplicate ident, do not use this
duplicate ident, instead generate new ones and delete these when appropriate.

XXX we must do NFC normalization at some point; when? not before storing the
file in the db (might need the original later on for e.g. hashing), we can
either do normalization on-the-fly or store a copy of the normalized text in
documents.

BUG xml.pretty removes spaces it shouldn't

Run the website with a debug interface always, copy the whole raw request
somewhere (secondary db?), and do that in python without buffering, so that we
can track issues

FIX <p><ul></ul></p> not allowed in HTML5, fix that by using a <div> instead of

shouldn't store separately the app from all the data files, because we need the
data files to be present to do anything with the db. the app code is useless
on its own. add projdoc as a submodule? can we still do a git pull in the app
repo without having git complain that the repo has been modified?
everything should be in the same repo. maybe use a reload command that reloads
data files _but not the code_?

in fact we have 2 build levels: fetch files from the fs, and parse the
documents. should do the minimum whenever possible.

for now, when processing docs, store both the commit of the app and the commit
of projdoc. but first actually put the schemas + html into projdoc

===

do not reopen the same text file several times, only read it a single time and
do not access the external file once stored in the db, because it might disappear
or be modified by change.py.
look at validate.py and parse_ins, mostly
XXX maybe better to use a dummy file object that is adapted from the db
and contains the file path + the data + maybe other useful stuff; reuse what
we have for File() in validate.py, and put it in texts.py

FILE ABSTRACTION object (copy go stuff)
should have File class + a MemFile that overrides the relevant methods

===

think about decorator to add for logging activity automatically for important
funcs; also might add a timer to these functions, so that we have "starting X"
"X completed in ...".

find a way to signal duplicate files and duplicate bib entries and errors in
projdoc.

actually use dharma.rng, only in /texts for now, afterwards distribute it;

add somewhere a date indicating when we
last updated the validation code (project-doc); but first need to deploy
schemas outside of my rtepo

do a redirect /foo/ -> /foo in nginx _but_ watch out with the /zotero-proxy
stuff.

== refs

note invalid local uris with @ref, color in red or sth. but we should resolve
links later on!

§ "Referring to inscriptions in the DHARMABase"
for ref @target, must not use @n and must use normalized urls; propose:

  /corpus/DHARMA_INSSomething
  /repositories/tfd-nusantara-philology
  /participants/argr (= part:argr (participant))

but oxygen suggests for @target all files in the same dir as the one being
edited, must change that as well

fix all XXX | FIXME

cumulative timeout for flashing https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/setTimeout

Make the top menu sticky on pc? no. Add a button to show/hide the left sidebar (on
pc); where? left of the top menu downward-pointing > thing. The left sidebar
shouldn't pop when we arrive to the page footer, how? The left sidebard should
be resizable, but then dimensions need to be saved as a cookie because reloading
the page will mess up the size.

Generate a site map (wget?).

Use the w3c validator API https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html with random
urls to detect issues; submit URLs like so:

  https://validator.w3.org/nu/?out=json&doc=$URL

Check for multiple uses of the same bib entry as in https://dharman.in/display/DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00050#bibliography (disallow?)

Work on parse and find a protocol for correcting files. Would probably be best
to do the parsing and correcting in the same spot, for easier maintenance, but
should not do this on the same tree.

Print somewhere which git names we don't have, auto-update it.


Add a "status" search field to catalog to filter by error status.

add tooltip for expan in <abbr><expan> in phys disp; but need to know how to do
that

Script maturity is for use only with the class "Brahmi and derivatives" (and
its subcategories); for any other script classes it is not optional but
"forbidden". For Brahmi, it is mandatory. Amend rules accordingly.

* fix incorrect verse numbers that should be in Roman in DHARMA_INSCIC00066

# Testing

check that the new change.py works
check that zotero syncing works

Must add tests for this, with dummy repos

Also create a few test files for checking display is working

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

------------------------------------------------------------------

# XML display

Put the tab button somewhere else.

* Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
  doesn't add unnecessary space.
* Also add line numbers
* Style the thing with a color for comments and tags, maybe different colors
  for milestones and logical elements.
* Add error messages with popups in the XML.

------------------------------------------------------------------

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like

Parse urls and make them clickable



# Tamil

Should we do the search stuff in Python, go or C? Since we are going to query
the db, might be simpler to have a SQLite extension, but then we must write
at least the binding code in C. For testing, it would be better to have an
interface that accepts commands, separate from sqlite. It's probably best to
do everything through a sqlite extension, even if it's annoying, because this
way we're protected from transaction issues.

Write the main code in go for simplicity. Add a basic argc,argv func as an
entry point, and wrap this function in C with minimum code.


# Parallels

Allow quoting part of the input with "..." to force an exact substring match.
Still keep using the same similarity measure. When there are several quoted
passages, allow overlaps viz. "foo"f"fo" match "foo". Or not? require the
matched strings to occur in the same order? In fact having a second field for
filtering seems better.

This should be linked to the catalog search features.
