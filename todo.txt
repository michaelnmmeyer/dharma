* Fix logic in parse.py, use decorators for handlers and see how XSLT
  does things. Use a default handler somewhere.
* Physical display. Keep [****], but in logiical use the convention
  described in editorial
* In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages
* Les espaces _ et <space/> à afficher seulement en physical
* Fix formatting of page nmbers in biblio, missing "p.~"

make a list of common errors + suggestions about the current egd

add trang transforms to relaxng so that we can do schema updates online from
the python code; but also need to figure out the TEI stuff for converting odd
code.

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

XXX make sure file names are unique across all repos

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

Regardre pour le tamoul. DSAL+Cologne. First start with just a word index, then
add scans, then other stuff. Need to have a grammar that describes how
transliteration works and that has some stuff on phonetics. can icu
transliterate tamil?

Ajouter 2nd champ dans rech. parallèles; pour substring; or allow quoting part
of the input to force an exact match.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use ul instead.
