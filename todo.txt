must merge all dbs together, except for the github log. use the db name as a
prefix in table names, so we can still do select on multi tables.

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Find a way to merge several tooltips when necessary as in A | B ... for this to
work, must annotate spans of text. And use a data table for common cases where
no dynamic generation is necessary (or at least to provide a general
explanation). Should also attach to each generated piece of text the xml node
it comes from (with lineno), to make it easier to debug stuff. Should also
highlight stuff that has a tooltip on mouseover. or add sth that indicates that
it has a tooltip.

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

ID pour les <lg> Amandine ? Must keep a copy of the XML of each <lg> in the db,
with the repo name, the commit num and the file name and the line no, so that
we can point back to an older version if the ref is lost.

must make ids unique across all elements, not just lgs. use <anchor
xml:id="foo"/>

   name text not null,
   id text not null,

);

Ajouter 2nd champ dans rech. parallèles; pour substring; or allow quoting part

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use ul instead.

For searching and highlighting, maybe the most convenient option for now would
be to have an offset map for each search representation that maps each
character to the corresponding offset in the formatted representation. This can
be compressed with delta encoding and varints. Go for that instead of what is
said above. And search representations should be derived from the formatted
representation, and this should be done in go, with a separate process.
