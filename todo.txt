Might want to generate this from the HTML. Spot all titles and make a toc
accordingly, so that it works for all pages. Do it in JS?

for the catalog, we'll also need a sidebar.



=============================================================


* Display remainder of teiheader
* Check tags we don't support yet
* Sort out languages tagging
* Fix logic in parse.py, use decorators for handlers and see how XSLT
  does things.
* Physical display. Keep [****], but in logiical use the convention
  described in editorial
* In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages
* Les espaces _ et <space/> à afficher seulement en physical
* Fix formatting of page nmbers in biblio, missing "p.~"

INSTamilNadu00102: look at <l> within the large <lg>; number 5,10,15; avec des
   numéros sur la droite

--------------------------------------------------------

check that the new change.py works

---------------------------------------------------------global

make a list of common errors + suggestions about the current egd

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

* EGD annex B on meters for auto recognition of meters ; which one?
* plain texts for in a month

-----------------------------------------------------------dominic

dicts:
* add nws.uzi.uni-halle.de ; juste la colonne de gauche.
* add the (incomplete) one from pune "an encyclopedic ... on historical principals"; available
  on; on koeln + from peter scharf?

------------------------------------------------------------------

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

XXX make sure we complain when file names are not unique across all repos
