we can do partial validation with relaxng; see test.rnc. for now should only
specify weird stuff, we will import the rest later on. should follow a top-down
approach.

the file table should include the extension, because not all files we need to
save in the db are XML; store the extension separately from the file base name
so that we can still easily join this table with texts.

parse urls and make them clickable

add tooltip for expan in <abbr><expan> in phys disp; but need to know how to do that

create a "browse by repo" page (so that we can leave behind the static website)

<label> to handle properly for manu

manu: <milestone unit="zone">; should be a title, with <lb> a children

make biblio searchable

amandine: <persName ref=PSN...>? should use key

check for overlapping colors, keep the most specific one; except for pb/lb,
which should remain in grey

allow click to make tips persistent

make docker not use root

fix toc on lhs

manu: flash bib not working on the same page

faire redirection huma-num: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#label/Work/FMfcgzGwJJfrhJhChztpctbBsQwmCwpk

amandine: faire un display pour bestow, simplifier schema bestow

Script maturity is for use only with the class "Brahmi and derivatives" (and
its subcategories); for any other script classes it is not optional but
"forbidden". For Brahmi, it is mandatory. Amend rules accordingly.

add log (or docker thing?) to get notified when the app is killed; should
redirect all logs to some definite location


include all the commits we missed in the commits tbl (use the commit date when
no push date is available); paginate stuff

* fix incorrect verse numbers that should be in Roman in DHARMA_INSCIC00066

* Sort out languages tagging; assign language categories (lang of
  the ed. or of the rest, main or secondary lang; probably not
  useful to keep track of <foreign>)

--------------------------------------------------------- manu



* In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages. XXX
  hyphens between words? or at the end fo a line?



manu: grantha translit with button several states translit methods

-----------------------------------------------------------

Display remainder of teiheader. What needs to be shown?

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt
   ./pubPlace (ignore the rest)

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/sourceDesc

===========================================================

add a side menu for navigating inscriptions. on mobile, make it collapse. the
toggle button should be on the menu bar, to save space.
even on pc, must have a button to hide/show it. also must be possible to
redimension it.
XXX the menu on the left is not really sticky.

   Metadata
   Edition+
   Apparatus?
   Translation*
   Commentary?
   Bibliography?
   Notes?
   XML source

for the catalog, we'll also need a sidebar.

--------------------------------------------------------

check that the new change.py works
check that zotero syncing works

---------------------------------------------------------global


Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

-----------------------------------------------------------dominic

dicts:
* add nws.uzi.uni-halle.de ; juste la colonne de gauche.
* add the (incomplete) one from pune "an encyclopedic ... on historical principals"; available
  on; on koeln + from peter scharf?

------------------------------------------------------------------

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

XXX make sure we complain when file names are not unique across all repos

----------------------------------------------------------------manu

Regardre pour le tamoul.

Ajouter 2nd champ dans rech. parallÃ¨les; pour substring; or allow quoting part
