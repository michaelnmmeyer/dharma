Find a way to merge several tooltips when necessary. And use a data table.
Should also attach to each generated piece of text the xml node it comes from

preserves space and doesn't add unnecessary space.

For searching and highlighting, maybe the most convenient option for now would
be to have an offset map for each search representation that maps each
character to the corresponding offset in the formatted representation. This can
be compressed with delta encoding and varints. Go for that instead of what is
said above. And search representations should be derived from the formatted
representation, and this should be done in go, with a separate process.
