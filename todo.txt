Script maturity is for use only with the class "Brahmi and derivatives" (and
its subcategories); for any other script classes it is not optional but
"forbidden". For Brahmi, it is mandatory. Amend rules accordingly.

redirect all logs to some definite location


include all the commits we missed in the commits tbl (use the commit date when

* fix incorrect verse numbers that should be in Roman in DHARMA_INSCIC00066

  the ed. or of the rest, main or secondary lang; probably not
  useful to keep track of <foreign>)

--------------------------------------------------------- manu



* In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages. XXX
  hyphens between words? or at the end fo a line?



manu: grantha translit with button several states translit methods

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831
