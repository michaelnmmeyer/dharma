need to speed up the build

amandine; display

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

==============================================================

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

to debug schemas, collect all <define name="tei_..."> in the rng (should all
start with tei_, but do check) and then substitute all <ref name="tei_...">
with the contents, recursively, so that we end up with tag names instead of tei
categories.


XXX make sure file names are unique across all repos

for phys display, use <p class=line> for lines and <div class=folio|page...>
for larger sections.

must merge all dbs together, except for the github log. use the db name as a
prefix in table names, so we can still do select on multi tables.

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Find a way to merge several tooltips when necessary as in A | B ... for this to
work, must annotate spans of text. And use a data table for common cases where
no dynamic generation is necessary (or at least to provide a general
explanation). Should also attach to each generated piece of text the xml node
it comes from (with lineno), to make it easier to debug stuff. Should also
highlight stuff that has a tooltip on mouseover. or add sth that indicates that
it has a tooltip.

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

Regardre pour le tamoul. DSAL+Cologne. First start with just a word index, then
add scans, then other stuff. Need to have a grammar that describes how
transliteration works and that has some stuff on phonetics. can icu
transliterate tamil?

ID pour les <lg> Amandine ? Must keep a copy of the XML of each <lg> in the db,
with the repo name, the commit num and the file name and the line no, so that
we can point back to an older version if the ref is lost.

must make ids unique across all elements, not just lgs. use <anchor
xml:id="foo"/>

create table verses(
   name text not null,
   id text not null,
   repo text,
   commit text,
   name text,
   data xml,
   line integer,
   column integer,
   primary key(name, id),
   foreign key(repo, name) references ...
);

Ajouter 2nd champ dans rech. parallèles; pour substring; or allow quoting part
of the input to force an exact match.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use ul instead.
