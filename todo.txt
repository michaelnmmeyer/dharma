Work on parse and find a protocol for correcting files. Would probably be best to do the parsing and correcting in the same spot, for easier maintenance, but should not do this on the same tree.

# Names

Don't expand names in documents tables! Because must be automatically
updated after a modif to idListMembers. Should store the dharma id (part:xxxx)
instead, even if we don't find it in idListmembers. When there is none, store
the name directly. Or update everything each time "idListMembers" is modified.

In fact we still need to update the search index, so do a full update. Simplest is to force a full update each time project-documentation is modified. Language names too need to be indexed.

Can make a distinction between DHARMA members and others just by looking whether we have a DHARMA id.

Print somewhere which git names we don't have, auto-update it.


===

Merge catalog and texts into a single interface. Need first to add a search
field to filter by error status. Must also be prepared to index documents that are completely invalid, in which case just display text id + repo in the catalog, and the XML in the display.

===

compare dipled and ins schemas, support dipled


add tooltip for expan in <abbr><expan> in phys disp; but need to know how to do that

===

# Find solution for nesting of phys structure

manu: <milestone unit="zone">; should be a title, with <lb> as children

make biblio searchable

  cited:true
  from-editor:
  from-repo:
  ...

amandine: <persName ref=PSN...>? should use key

allow click to make tips persistent on PC (already automatic on phone) so that
we can select and copy-paste footnotes' contents.

populate aside menu on phone

when flashing entries in the global biblio, the flashed entry is below the bar on mobile.

make docker not use root (and thus maybe avoid the git trust repo issue in dockerfile)

revoir config nginx

faire redirection huma-num: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#label/Work/FMfcgzGwJJfrhJhChztpctbBsQwmCwpk

amandine: faire un display pour bestow, simplifier schema bestow

Script maturity is for use only with the class "Brahmi and derivatives" (and
its subcategories); for any other script classes it is not optional but
"forbidden". For Brahmi, it is mandatory. Amend rules accordingly.

include all the commits we missed in the commits tbl (use the commit date when
no push date is available); paginate stuff

* fix incorrect verse numbers that should be in Roman in DHARMA_INSCIC00066

* Sort out languages tagging; assign language categories (lang of
  the ed. or of the rest, main or secondary lang; probably not
  useful to keep track of <foreign>)

--------------------------------------------------------- manu



manu: In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages. XXX
  hyphens between words? or at the end fo a line?



manu: grantha translit with button several states translit methods

-----------------------------------------------------------

Display remainder of teiheader. What needs to be shown?

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt
   ./pubPlace (ignore the rest)

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/publicationStmt

/TEI/teiHeader/fileDesc/sourceDesc

===========================================================

add a side menu for navigating inscriptions. on mobile, make it collapse. the
toggle button should be on the menu bar, to save space.
even on pc, must have a button to hide/show it. also must be possible to
redimension it.
XXX the menu on the left is not really sticky.

   Metadata
   Edition+
   Apparatus?
   Translation*
   Commentary?
   Bibliography?
   Notes?
   XML source

for the catalog, we'll also need a sidebar.

--------------------------------------------------------

# Testing

check that the new change.py works
check that zotero syncing works

Must add tests for this, with dummy repos

Also create a few test files for checking display is working

XXX make sure we complain when file names are not unique across all repos


---------------------------------------------------------global


Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

------------------------------------------------------------------

# XML display

Put the tab button somewhere else.

* Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
  doesn't add unnecessary space.
* Also add line numbers
* Style the thing with a color for comments and tags, maybe different colors
  for milestones and logical elements.
* Add error messages with popups in the XML.

------------------------------------------------------------------

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.




Parse urls and make them clickable



# Tamil

Should we do the search stuff in Python, go or C?


# Parallels

Allow quoting part of the input with "..." to force an exact substring match.
Still keep using the same similarity measure.

This should be linked to the catalog search features.
