are we displaying invalid XML files in the catalog? no. add a placeholder both
in the catalog and in the display.

actually use dharma.rng, only in /texts for now, afterwards distribute it;
check that we're correct at each step; add somewhere a date indicating when we
last updated the validation code

§ "Referring to inscriptions in the DHARMABase"
for ref @target, must not use @n and must use normalized urls; propose:

  /repositories/tfd-nusantara-philology
  /participants/argr (= part:argr (participant))

but oxygen suggests for @target all files in the same dir as the one being
edited, must change that as well

Make the top menu sticky on pc? no. Add a button to show/hide the left sidebar (on
pc); where? left of the top menu downward-pointing > thing. The left sidebar
shouldn't pop when we arrive to the page footer, how? The left sidebard should
be resizable, but then dimensions need to be saved as a cookie because reloading
the page will mess up the size.

Change how the "Logical", "Physical" etc. stuff works in such a way that opening
a new tab by clicking on Logical, etc. works. But how to deal with history
feature? Keep track of it at all? Maybe shouldn't for display pages, but then
permalinks will work weirdly.

Work on parse and find a protocol for correcting files. Would probably be best
to do the parsing and correcting in the same spot, for easier maintenance, but
should not do this on the same tree.

# Names

Don't expand names in documents tables! Because must be automatically
updated after a modif to idListMembers. Should store the dharma id (part:xxxx)
instead, even if we don't find it in idListmembers. When there is none, store
the name directly. Or update everything each time "idListMembers" is modified.

In fact we still need to update the search index, so do a full update. Simplest
is to force a full update each time project-documentation is modified. Language
names too need to be indexed.

Can make a distinction between DHARMA members and others just by looking whether we have a DHARMA id.

Print somewhere which git names we don't have, auto-update it.

Merge catalog and texts into a single interface. Need first to add a search
field to filter by error status. Must also be prepared to index documents that are completely invalid, in which case just display text id + repo in the catalog, and the XML in the display.

Script maturity is for use only with the class "Brahmi and derivatives" (and
its subcategories); for any other script classes it is not optional but
"forbidden". For Brahmi, it is mandatory. Amend rules accordingly.

* fix incorrect verse numbers that should be in Roman in DHARMA_INSCIC00066

* Sort out languages tagging; assign language categories (lang of
  the ed. or of the rest, main or secondary lang; probably not
  useful to keep track of <foreign>)

manu: In physical display, do not display editorial hyphens, but do show them
  in logical display. For this to work, need to tag languages. XXX
  hyphens between words? or at the end fo a line?

===========================================================

add a side menu for navigating inscriptions. on mobile, make it collapse. the
toggle button should be on the menu bar, to save space.
even on pc, must have a button to hide/show it. also must be possible to
redimension it.
XXX the menu on the left is not really sticky.

   Metadata
   Edition+
   Apparatus?
   Translation*
   Commentary?
   Bibliography?
   Notes?

for the catalog, we'll also need a sidebar.

--------------------------------------------------------

# Testing

check that the new change.py works
check that zotero syncing works

Must add tests for this, with dummy repos

Also create a few test files for checking display is working

XXX make sure we complain when file names are not unique across all repos


---------------------------------------------------------global


Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

------------------------------------------------------------------

# XML display

Put the tab button somewhere else.

* Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
  doesn't add unnecessary space.
* Also add line numbers
* Style the thing with a color for comments and tags, maybe different colors
  for milestones and logical elements.
* Add error messages with popups in the XML.

------------------------------------------------------------------

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use cards instead.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.




Parse urls and make them clickable



# Tamil

Should we do the search stuff in Python, go or C? Since we are going to query
the db, might be simpler to have a SQLite extension, but then we must write
at least the binding code in C. For testing, it would be better to have an
interface that accepts commands, separate from sqlite. It's probably best to
do everything through a sqlite extension, even if it's annoying, because this
way we're protected from transaction issues.

Write the main code in go for simplicity. Add a basic argc,argv func as an
entry point, and wrap this function in C with minimum code.


# Parallels

Allow quoting part of the input with "..." to force an exact substring match.
Still keep using the same similarity measure. When there are several quoted
passages, allow overlaps viz. "foo"f"fo" match "foo". Or not? require the
matched strings to occur in the same order? In fact having a second field for
filtering seems better.

This should be linked to the catalog search features.
