add trang transfo so that we can di schema updates online

need to download noto fonts and do the subsetting ourselves, because vəR̥ḥ is
not rendered properly

need to speed up validation & co.
* only consider files that changed; for this need to keep track of changed
  directories
* just do a quick validation, don't store results in the db, only do a full
  validation when necessary
* stop doing the git log follow thing, super slow

amandine; display

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

XXX make sure file names are unique across all repos

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

Regardre pour le tamoul. DSAL+Cologne. First start with just a word index, then
add scans, then other stuff. Need to have a grammar that describes how
transliteration works and that has some stuff on phonetics. can icu

Ajouter 2nd champ dans rech. parallèles; pour substring; or allow quoting part
of the input to force an exact match.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use ul instead.
