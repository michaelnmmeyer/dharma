add trang transforms to relaxng so that we can do schema updates online from
the python code

need to speed up validation & co.
* only consider files that changed; for this need to keep track of changed
  directories
* just do a quick validation, don't store results in the db, only do a full
  validation when necessary
* stop doing the git log follow thing, super slow

amandine; display

Problems with @n.
* We should restrict the number of containers where numbers should be unique to
just divs and lgs + maybe a special case for p that contains @n + paras
(Andrea). Also need to discuss Andrea's case.
* There should be no distinction of namespace for different types of
milestones.
* The repetitive scheme is not clear and unpredictable. Should have a clearer
convention.

for rng: rng2srng-20020831

note that we can link to a span of text on github by adding sth like
#L8C23-L14C34 at the end; but doesn't work with just #L8C23.

XXX make sure file names are unique across all repos

move texts db stuff in change.py to texts.py

Can add options to the xml display. Just a "pretty" option where we might or
not include comments. Need to have a pretty-print func that preserves space and
doesn't add unnecessary space. Also add line numbers to xml display. And style
the thing with a color for comments and tags.

Regardre pour le tamoul. DSAL+Cologne. First start with just a word index, then
add scans, then other stuff. Need to have a grammar that describes how
transliteration works and that has some stuff on phonetics. can icu
transliterate tamil?

Ajouter 2nd champ dans rech. parallèles; pour substring; or allow quoting part
of the input to force an exact match.

stop using tables in website, annoying to style. use ul instead.
