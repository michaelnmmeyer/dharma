The schema can be inferred from the file name:
DHARMA_DiplEd
DHARMA_CritEd
DHARMA_INS
But check that the schemas these files use is actually the one we expect.

But we have two exceptions:
DHARMA_MS_Descr_Or3429.xml
DHARMA_Sircar1965.xml


== Plans

# Validation

Should have a useful validation, something that gives us guarantees about the
ability to process files and to do something with them. TEI and EpiDoc are so
generic that it's not possible to have useful tool.

Set up some tooling for validating XML texts in the repos, with the existing
Schematron files and maybe some extra scripts for things that need to be tested
with real programming. Also validate the bibliographic entries they reference
at the same time. This should all be doable at the command line and be quick
enough (run as a service ?)

Should use a layered validation process: first test basic textual conformance
(encoding, etc.), then XML, then TEI, then EpiDoc, then finally our schemas.

Test the validation process. We must ensure that the files that are considered
valid now remain so when we update the schema, etc. It must be kept in mind
that some people won't modify their files anymore (left the project, etc.) and
that we don't have access to all files, so changing things in a
backward-incompatible way is _not_ OK.

Need to normalize:

   <persName ref="part:jodo">
   <forename>John</forename>
   <surname>Doe</surname>
   </persName>

We already have a mapping in
https://github.com/erc-dharma/project-documentation/blob/master/DHARMA_idListMembers_v01.xml
so no reason to duplicate the data.

Plenty of useless markup we can systematically remove and patch later on.


# Conversion

Set up a XML->(almost plain) text conversion system, a readable representation
of the internal representation we'll use for search, the simplest one for now.
(Later on we'll need a more complicated search representation to support
highlighting search results in full documents.) At this stage don't try to
process files that were rejected as invalid beforehand. We assume the files are
correct in the conversion code, we don't attempt to validate things here,
otherwise the conversion code will be too complicated and unmaintainable. This
conversion code will be used at search time for highlighting search results, so
it must be fast; probably should write it in go as well as all the
server-related stuff.

Add a XML->HTML conversion capability to our basic conversion system. Should
use an intermediate representation, but which one? Could preprocess XML files
to keep just what we need in a convenient format, then generate the HTML from
there. We'll need to generate the HTML at search time, so should be fast and
written in go.

The best solution for the intermediate representation is to use a custom
bytecode and to evaluate it differently depending on what we want to generate.
We should store this representation in the db. The main advantage of using this
representation is to avoid having to manipulate hairy structures.

Add a XML->LaTeX conversion. Need not be fast, can be done in python, we'll
pregenerate stuff.


# Extra

Figure out something for simplifying the encoding process. We already have
Schematron quick fixes, but it'd also be useful to write some routines that
fill automatically stuff that can be done mechanically (license, etc.) or
propose various transformations. Maybe have a way to accept/reject a given
transformation. Does SQF support this kind of thing? If so, does it also
support calling external scripts, etc.?
