"""
This does the following:

* Drop the initial BOM, if any
* Remove spurious whitespace at the end of each line (this breaks markdown code
  that uses trailing spaces instead of <br/>, but this convention is stupid
  anyway so we don't care).
* Use the same newline character throughout
* Drop empty lines at the beginning of the file and at its end
* Make sure the file ends with a newline character
* Normalize the text to NFC

Should also normalize whitespace and remove weird chars, at least:
* DerivedNormalizationProps.txt:Default_Ignorable_Code_Point
* PropList.txt:White_Space
