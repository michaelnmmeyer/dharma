              <p>Halantas. Final T in l1 seems to be a slightly reduced ta with a headmark much like the regular one; it may also be an erroneous ta instead of T.</p>
              <p>Original punctuation marks</p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations. The consonants ka and ra occur in both short and long forms. Anusvāra is usually above the character to which it belongs, but often to the right of that consonant and occasionally atop the next character (e.g. l8 maṁgi; l9 kuṭiṁbinas; l11 vedāṁga; l22, ṁjalir). Dependent i and ī are rarely distinguished and are read as expected where there is no clear indication of either. See also the commentary.<!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

              <note>The characters <foreign>taya</foreign> are at the lower edge of the binding hole, and are therefore reduced in size and slightly distorted in shape. I cannot fully reconstruct RM's reading and emendation. At the end of line 4, he apparently reads <foreign>jayaśilati</foreign> and emends the final vowel to <foreign>ā</foreign>. A footnote by his editor completes this emendation to <foreign>jayāsi-latā</foreign>. In line 5 it is also clear that RM emends <foreign>śū</foreign> to <foreign>sū</foreign>, but I fail to understand what he intends with the word <foreign>praroha</foreign>, shown in his edition in round parentheses. He probably means this to replace the preceding word he reads as <foreign>praśūtāya</foreign>, but if so, then I do not see why he first emends that to <foreign>prasūtāya</foreign>. No matter what RM intended, we have a close parallel in lines 10-11 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, which describe Jayasiṁha I as <foreign>°āneka-samara-saṁghaṭṭa-labdha-vijaya-śīlatā-prasūta-yaśaḥ-prasūtāmoda-gandhādhivāsita-sakala-dig-maṇḍalasya</foreign> (where <foreign>-prasūtāmoda-</foreign> is probably erroneous for <foreign>-prasūty-āmoda-</foreign>). The phrase <foreign>jaya-śrī-latā</foreign> in place of <foreign>jaya-śīlatā</foreign> is unexpected, but the subscript <foreign>r</foreign> is unmistakeable in the photo even in its worn state. It is possible that all of <foreign>praśūtaya</foreign> at the beginning of line 5 was intended to be cancelled, in which case we are left with a more elegant compound involving <foreign>jaya-śrī-latā</foreign>; but the text is interpretable with the above minor emendations even if all characters are retained.</note>

              <note>I endorse RM's reading, which he prints as clear. In fact, both characters are somewhat problematic, though there is little doubt as to the reading. The first character has an exaggerated headmark and its right limb seems to be attached too far down. The second is apparently <foreign>gi</foreign> with an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> placed in the middle of the circular vowel mark.</note>

As for the second character, I see no indication of <foreign>u</foreign>, much less of <foreign>ū</foreign>, but accept the joint testimony of two scholars who have read something of the kind here. It is clear from the photo that the surface is very worn here. The upper part of the third character definitely looks like <foreign>ḻ</foreign>, but a damaged <foreign>ṟ</foreign> (as read in ARIE) is not out of the question; in addition, the character could be <foreign>ḫpa</foreign>.</note>

              <note>Although RM prints most of this text as clearly legible, neither the estampage nor the photo confirms his reading. Though the syntax of the sentence is garbled, I expect only one name here (see the note to the translation). I cannot definitively exclude RM's reading. To my eye, the first illegible character does not seem likely to be <foreign>śa</foreign>; the second could perhaps be <foreign>ma</foreign> or <foreign>vā</foreign>; and the third is altogether indiscernible. My tentatively read <foreign>Ā</foreign> (apparently ignored or read as a punctuation mark by RM) could, on its own, be <foreign>dra</foreign> or <foreign>vra</foreign>, and my tentative <foreign>ḍi</foreign> (RM's <foreign>gi</foreign>) may also be <foreign>di</foreign>, <foreign>dhi</foreign> or <foreign>vi</foreign>.</note>

              <note>In line 11, the character read as <foreign>vi</foreign> could well be <foreign>ni</foreign> or <foreign>bhi</foreign>, and the one read as <foreign>sa</foreign> is wholly indiscernible in the estampage, though it does resemble <foreign>sa</foreign> in the photo. The final consonant could also be <foreign>v</foreign> instead of <foreign>n</foreign>, and does not appear to have an <foreign>e</foreign> marker. RM seems to take all of this string as a topnym in the locative, but he does not discuss it at all in his introduction. An editorial footnote interpets this as <q>the camping place</q>, presumably of Maṅgi Yuvarāja, and identifies it as the village Maṇḍūru near the modern village Mopaṟṟu. Given the convincing identification, I accept the reading, but retain a great degree of doubt. second character in line 12 is a complex and strange conjunct free from damage that looks most like <foreign>ñcū</foreign>. Compare the very differently shaped <foreign>ṇḍa</foreign> further on in this line, and the very similar <foreign>ñca</foreign> in line 15. It is preceded by a conspicuous dot that may be an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>, but is probably only the headmark on the right limb of ma. The following character, also undamaged, lacks a cross-stroke, so it looks like <foreign>ḻū</foreign> rather than <foreign>ṟū</foreign>. Moreover, given its flat top, <foreign>dhū</foreign> is also possible. Compare <foreign>dha</foreign> in line 13 which, though slightly damaged, looks very similar. The top of the following <foreign>r</foreign> has been worn off at the edge of the binding hole; conceivably, it may also have been <foreign>k</foreign>. I see no indication of an <foreign>e</foreign> attached to it, but one may have been lost along with the top of the body.</note>

              <note>Although the modern village Yellavarru is close on the southeast to modern Moparru, RM's reading cannot be right. I see no way to read the first character as <foreign>I</foreign>; it seems to be <foreign>ve</foreign>, but could perhaps also be <foreign>me</foreign> or <foreign>vo</foreign>. The second is very clearly a conjunct with <foreign>l</foreign> in the upper part.

              <note>If RM's reading at the end of 2r is interpretable, then it may be correct. Both the estampage and the photo are quite clear, and to me the characters seem to be as shown in my edition; the first may perhaps also be <foreign>kṣo</foreign>. The first character on 2v seems to belong to this phrase. The Sanskrit words from the second character onward are reasonably clear in the photo.</note>

      <div type="commentary">
        <p>The text ends abruptly with the last line on 3r. I agree with RM that only a very small amount of text seems to be missing here, most probably identifying the writer of the text. RM believes a date was also lost here, but I do not find this likely on the basis of parallel grants. It is not clear whether the last bit of text in line 26 is prose or a garbled continuation of the <foreign>indravajrā</foreign> hemistich identifying the executor; nor is it clear whether Ghanarāśi and Bhānuśakti are two separate persons or only one. The intended text may for instance have been something like <foreign>tac-chāsanasyāsya ca lekha-karttā</foreign>. The photographs published by the National Museum include a picture of 3v, and there seems to be no trace of writing there whatsoever. Perhaps the text was intended to be complete as it is. The last character, <foreign>li</foreign>, may have been intended as an abbreviation for <foreign>likhita</foreign>, and the symbol after it might be an abbreviation marker. Assuming that the second hemistich intended by the composer was shortened by the scribe to fit the text on the plate, it seems most likely that Ghanarāśi was the executor and Bhānuśakti was the writer.</p>
        <p>The issuer of these plates was identified in the ARIE report as Jayasiṁha I on the grounds that the seal bears the legend <foreign>sarvasiddhi</foreign> and only Kīrtivarman and Viṣṇuvardhana (I) are mentioned as ancestors in the genealogy. RM, however, asserts that <foreign>maṅgi-yuva-vallabha-mahārāja</foreign> is clearly the donor. While I must point out that neither instance of the name <foreign>maṁgi</foreign> is quite clear, the reading is indeed quite secure. RM adds that, since Maṅgi Yuvarāja’s seals have the legend <foreign>vijayasiddhi</foreign>, the seal may not be the original seal of this grant. He further supposes that reference to the closer ancestry of Maṅgi Yuvarāja was apparently <q>left out by oversight</q>. His editor in EI (probably K. G. Krishnan) adds in a footnote that there may have been <q>a mix up of two different plates at a distant time</q>. Moreover, RM notes that the donor’s epithet is <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign> in line 6, but says only that this <q>means the same</q> as Maṅgi Yuvarāja’s regular epithet <foreign>sarvalokāśraya</foreign>. However, the two epithets are not necessarily interchangeable. The question of the issuer needs further study.</p>
        <p>Some details to consider are the following. <list>
            <item>1, The phraseology of the grant has much in common with known grants of Maṅgi Yuvarāja. However, it has just as much in common with grants of Jayasiṁha I and Viṣṇuvardhana II, most especially with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that all grants of Maṅgi known to me begin with a more mature version of the stock text <foreign>śrīmatāṁ sakala-</foreign>.</item>
            <item>2, The genealogy begins with Kīrtivarman, whereas grants of Maṅgi known to me begin either with Jayasiṁha I or with Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana. Genealogies beginning with Kīrtivarman are found in all grants of Jayasiṁha I that I know, one grant of Viṣṇuvardhana II (of the two I know), and the single known grant of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka.</item>
            <item>3, The exhortatory verses are unusual. Stanza 3 does not occur in any Eastern Cālukya grant I know of. Variants of stanza 4 occur (sporadically) only from the time of <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00018.xml">Vijayāditya I</ref> onward, and the first closely related variant is in <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00022.xml">a grant of Kali Viṣṇuvardhana</ref>. Stanza 6 occurs in at least one grant of Pulakeśin II, but among Eastern Cālukya charters, its only occurrence that I know of is in one of <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bhīma I</ref>.</item>
            <item>4, I have not verified this, but the elaborate headmarks of this inscription (usually long horizontal lines with the ends curved up) seem late to me. It may be that a later scribe was attempting to imitate an earlier style of writing. A more detailed study of the palaeography is warranted.</item>
          </list></p>
        <p>The idea that plates belonging to different grants have been mixed up strikes me as preposterous, since the page breaks concerned would have had to be at the same spot in the text. The idea that Indra Bhaṭṭāraka and Viṣṇuvardhana II were omitted out of oversight is likewise preposterous; moreover, the text progresses smoothly through <foreign>kīrttivarmmaṇaḥ sūnor … śrī-viṣṇuvarddhana-mahārājasya priya-tanayaḥ … śrī-maṁgi(?)-yuva-vallabha-mahārājaḥ</foreign>. Any omitted people would have had to have been included in the draft before <foreign>priya-tanayaḥ</foreign>, and the syntax would have been quite awkward. Forgery (produced some generations after Maṅgi Yuvarāja and probably using a genuine seal) seems quite likely, but I would expect a forger to have copied a specimen grant with alteration only in the executive section, rather than cobbling the text together from grants of different rulers.</p>
        <p>The possibility also remains that it is an idiosyncratic charter of the Maṅgi Yuvarāja we are familiar with. And there is, in addition, some chance that we are dealing here with an unknown Maṅgi Yuvarāja from an earlier time. This person could be either Jayasiṁha I before his formal accession to the throne, or Indra Bhaṭṭāraka. The former did use the epithets <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign> and (probably) <foreign>trailokya-vikrama</foreign>, and if the problematic locus in line 8 correctly reads <foreign>śrīmachrī</foreign> instead of <foreign>śrīmaṁgi</foreign>, then “the majestic <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign>, son of Viṣṇuvardhana” would clearly identify him. The latter, in turn, may well have spent part (perhaps a large part) of his life as <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign> under Jayasiṁha I. Although he is not known to have been called <foreign>sakala-lokāśraya</foreign> (indeed, he was, at least after his coronation, <foreign>siṁha-vikrama</foreign> and, probably, <foreign>rāja-lokāśraya</foreign>), yet if his personal name had been Maṅgi and if <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign> had stuck to him as a permanent epithet, then that would to some degree explain why his grandson bore the name Maṅgi Yuvarāja as a crowned king.</p>
