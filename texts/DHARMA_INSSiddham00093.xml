This is not explicitly stated but I assume that the inscription is on 1verso, 2recto and 3recto.
--><lb n="1"/><g type="mangala"/><!--
The mangala symbol is in fact located outside the margin, but the text is also indented after it so for the sake of simplicity I treat it as inline. Note that there are also marginal page numbers on plates 2 and 3.

The mangala symbol looks like a mirrored C.

A top mātrā was originally incised atop the left limb of mā in kumāradevas, then struck out with fine crosshatching. Lovely how such fine details can be made out in this photo. The character may have been inscribed as me or mo first, but this is more probably a random error. See line 19 for me, which has a pr̥ṣṭhamātrā, not a śiromātrā; and see e.g. l8 for mo, which has the upper mātrā extending from the hooked right-hand side of the character.

Jain emends to yathaivāsmād, but I find the eva out of place.
--><lb n="7"/>grāmād a<sic>ṅ</sic>śāḥ pañca Arkkadāmasya <space/> vorāleḥ pañca| Avalaptasya<!--
All names are completely clear and legible; definitely not arkkadāsa, avalipta, or anything suchlike.
--><!--
The punctuation sign is a single, short dash. There is no such sign after arkkadāmasya.
--><!--
Jain does not transcribe the space and the punctuation sign, but lists the allotments of each person as indicated by these.
--><lb n="8"/>catvāraḥ haridattasya ttrayaḥ dāmodarasya <sic>dvayaḥ</sic> viṣṇusvāmina dvayaṁ<!--
Jain transcribes harīdattasya (emending to hari), but the vowel is clearly i. Jain may have been influenced by the size and elaborateness of the mātrā.
--><lb n="9"/>kumāra<sic>ś</sic>vāminaḥ A<sic>n</sic>śa-dvayaṁ <space/> prabhilasvāmine <sic>n</sic>śa-ttrayaṁ <space/> vodasvāmine <sic>ṅ</sic>śa-dvayaṁ<!--
Sic, anśa at the first and second occurrence, aṅśa at the third and elsewhere. (Jain transcribes the second as ṅ, but this is a typo or an error. Dental n pops up repeatedly below too, though many subsequent occurrences are transcribed as ṅ by Jain.)
--><!--
Jain emends vodasvāmin to vedasvāmin, plausible but far from certain since we have some non-Sanskritic names in the list.
--><!--
The spaces in this line are smaller than a regular character, but they are definitely spaces and their function is obviously to demarcate the items of the list.
--><lb n="10"/>vāsusvāmine <sic>ṅ</sic>śa-dvayaṁ somasvāmine <sic>n</sic>śāś catvāraḥ <space/> rudra<space/>śarmmāya A<sic>ṅ</sic>śaḥ<!--
Jain prints vasusvāmin, but it's clearly vāsu.
--><!--
The space after catvāraḥ is small. There is no space after dvayaṁ. The space in the middle of Rudraśarman's name is at least a full character wide and has no apparent explanation.
--><!--
Jain prints the avagraha at the end of l10 as supplied, but it's clearly there.
--><lb n="11"/>bhavanandasvāmine <sic>ṅ</sic>śaḥ Agnisvāmine <sic>n</sic>śaḥ rudradattasvāmine <sic>n</sic>śaḥ sūryadattasvā<!--
Jain apparently reads sūya, with an unclear ya, correcting to sūrya. The text is in fact clearly rya, with a regular r plus subscript y.
--><!--
No more demarcation spaces from this line onward, perhaps because the visargas double as separators.
--><lb break="no" n="12"/>mine <sic>n</sic>śaḥ nāgadinnasvāmine <sic>ṅ</sic>śaḥ paṇṇarasvām<sic>a</sic>ne <sic>n</sic>śaḥ<supplied reason="subaudible">.</supplied> Ebhir eva yathopari-li<!--
Jain prints parṇṇasvāmine. There is definitely no i mātrā over the m. The characters after pa may have been intended for rṇṇa, but they are a double ṇ without a repha, followed by a full-size ra.
--><lb break="no" n="13"/>khitaka-brāhmaṇair ata gr̥hītaka kṣattriya phālg<subst>
            <del rend="corrected">

          </subst><unclear>ḥ</unclear> A<sic>ṅ</sic>ś<sic>o</sic>kāś catv<sic>a</sic>raḥ si<sic>ṅ</sic>ha<!--
Jain prints grahītaka, emending to gr̥hītaka. The reading is in fact gr̥ to begin with.
--><!--
Jain offers no interpretation for ata. The reading is perfectly clear. It may have been meant for ataḥ, but that would serve no purpose here. Perhaps emend to atra?.
--><!--
Jain reads phalgu, emending to phalgune, which doesn't seem to make much sense. He gives the guy's name as Phalgu in his separate list of donees. The first character is clearly phā. The next character does look like lgu, but the u does not extend upward as far as it does in the name phālgudatta in l34, and there seems to be an o mātrā on top of the character. There also seems to be a visarga after the character. I think the most likely solution is that lgu was first inscribed, or at least begun, but the u mātrā was aborted and the o mātrā added.
--><!--
Jain emends to aṁśakāś catvāraḥ, which is very probably the intended meaning. The reading is, however, quite clear.
--><lb break="no" n="14"/>nāgasyā<sic>n</sic>śaḥ Ādityava<space quantity="2" unit="character"/>rmmaṇaḥ A<sic>n</sic>śa-dvayaM vaiśya śivadāsasya<!--
There's no obvious explanation for the space in ādityavarman's name; it must have been meant to leave room for "tvara" in the next line; see also note to l15.
--><!--
The halanta M is full sized, but looks different from a regular ma: the left-hand side is low, while the right-hand stroke is full-height and has a large serif on top (or a line above). The Ms in l16 and onward is even more bizarre.
--><lb n="15"/>tīhāradevasyā<sic>n</sic>śāś <choice>
            <sic>catvara</sic>
            <corr>catvāraḥ</corr>
          </choice><!--
Line 15 is less than half the length of the other lines, squeezed with difficulty into the remaining space at the bottom. Lines slant slightly downward from l12 on, so there would have been no room for a longer l15. Jain notes that this line appears to be a later addition. This is not impossible (the characters also seem less deeply engraved), but the conspicuous space in l14 doesn't seem to serve any other purpose than to leave room for the tops of the characters tvara in this line, which would not have fit in below rmma. This implies that l15 was incised at the same time as the other lines, and moreover, that it was written in ink or whatever before engraving. Then again, see my note to l17: I'm almost certain that the total number of donees was also changed from 24 to 25 after or in the course of the engraving.
--><!--
Jain reads pratīhāradeva. There is definitely no clear pra here. There may possibly be a character before tī, but the scratches there are very faint (more so than anything on this plate) and don't look like pra. In Jain's rubbing there is a curve at the bottom left corner that does resemble a subscript r, but comparing the rubbing and the photo, I am certain that this is the inner edge of the rim, not an incised line.
--><pb n="2r"/><lb n="16"/><num value="2">2</num>a<sic>n</sic>śa-dvayaM śūdra rāmaṇa-<space type="binding-hole"/>puttra-dāsasyā<sic>n</sic>śāś catvāraḥ rudra<!--
The number 2 at the beginning of the line (actually rather outside the margin, to the left of l16) is obviously a page number. It is not transcribed by Jain, unless by the = sign he puts at the beginning of the line, before which he has a footnote saying "This may probably indicate that the number of the plate is 2." Interestingly, Jain does not notice the page number on p3. need a way to deal with foliation - use fw tags?
--><!--
The halanta M is a full-size character that looks rather like a la.
--><lb break="no" n="17"/>dāsasyā<sic>n</sic>śa-dvayaM</p>
        <p>Evam ekattra <space type="binding-hole"/><unclear>paṁ</unclear>cavi<sic>n</sic>śatāṁ brāhmaṇādi-puro<!--
Interestingly, paṁ (if that's what it is) is inscribed on the very edge of the hole, while there is some space before and after ca, so pañca would have fit very comfortably even if as much space had been left empty around the hole as in l17.
--><!--
To make matters more interesting, vi actually looks more like rvi. Therefore I'm almost certain that the text originally inscribed was caturvinśatāṁ. Afterward, paṁ was added before ca, and tu was erased completely.
--><lb break="no" n="18"/>gānāṁ yathopari-likhitakānāṁ sva-puṇyābhi<sic>b</sic>r̥ddhaye puttra-prapauttra-tat-pu<lb break="no" n="19"/>ttrādy-anukkrameṇa candrārka-sama-kālikaḥ sodraṅgaḥ soparikaraḥ A-cāṭa<lb break="no" n="20"/>-bhaṭa-prāveśyaś cora-daṇḍa-varjjitaḥ Agrāhāratvenātisr̥ṣṭas<!--

Jain prints nā as supplied. I think it is actually there, but it is practically illegible and closer to the edge of the hole than expected.

        <p><lb n="39"/>Ājñā svayaM||<!--
The last line begins below sya of parvvatasya in l38. It is incised with much less care and apparently less deeply than the others.
--><!--
The expression ājñā svayam may be well known, but it's the firs time I see it. Apparently it means that there was no dūtaka, but the sāndhivigrahika (or whoever) came in person to the engravers to order the plates.

The closing punctuation is a double vertical.
