L1. The characters read in l1 are quite clear in the rubbing (or eye copy?) in ASIR15, but make no sense so they are probably not quite correct.
--></ab>

L2. The halanta T seems to be a full-size character with the right-hand arm extended to the left and curling up.
--><!--
L2. The reading of the numerals is very uncertain. This should be shown in the markup for both 66 and 7. Fleet says the reading is 60 and 6. Cunningham read 55 (in place-value notation). Bhagwanlal Indraji (as reported by Cunningham) interpreted the figures as 88, also in place value notation. Fleet admits (#Fleet_1888:209n1) that in Cunningham's facsimile the numbers do look like 55 or 88, but he thinks the time is too early for place-value notation. Going by the ASIR drawing and Ojha's numeral plates, I find 60 unlikely and 6 impossible; there is, however, a figure 9 (from Nepal, c8-9) that looks exactly like what we have here (in both numerals). Reading both as 8 also seems possible, but not too likely... Thaplyal follows Fleet and makes no comment.
--><!--
L2. Fleet prints śu di, and Thaplyal repeats this (in Devanagari). The ASIR drawing clearly has su, not śu. Fleet's plate is illegible in my scan.
--><!--
L2. For my asmin, Cunningham reads asyin and Fleet reads asyān. smi is quite clear in ASIR, in spite of the feminine late ron.
--><!--
L2. The ā of ādityasena is actually a in both the ASIR and the CII versions of the facsimile.

L3. de is missing from my scan; the right-hand side of va is visible.
--><!--
L3. Of the reconstructed name nālanda, the ASIR drawing only has a blotch for nā, and "nda" looks like śrā or grā. Neither is discernible in the CII version. Fleet admits the name "is rather doubtful" but believes "there is no special objection to reading it" as Nālanda is big and nearby.
--><!--
L3. Cunningham and Fleet both read °āgrahāre, but gr definitely has what looks like an ā mātrā in the ASIR facsimile. The CII facsimile is indistinct, but does seem to have an ā mātrā.
--><!--
L3. I wonder if "sādhunā" is in fact sāmanta. dhu is quite clear in ASIR, but much less so in CII and what is visible looks more like ma than dhu.
--><!--
L3. The va of valādhikr̥ta looks like vā or vo (or dā or do) in CII. I wonder if, in conjunction with my previous suggestion, the reading could be sāmantapālādhikr̥ta.
--><!--
L3. The ya of deyadharmmo seems to have been omitted. The ASIR copy looks like dedhurmmo
--><!--
L3. In the CII copy the sā of sālapakṣeṇa doesn't really look like the sa-s in the previous line; perhaps it's actually syā.
--><!--
L3. the ṣṭhi of pratiṣthita is di in the ASIR facsimile. Indistinct in CII. I wonder if the correct reading is really pratiditaṁ, emendable to pratipāditaṁ rather than to pratiṣṭhitaṁ (where one would expect pratiṣṭhāpitam).
--><lb
n="4"/>mātā-pitro<unclear>R Ā</unclear>tmanaś ca puṇyābhivr̥ddhaye<!--
L4. In ASIR the text seems to be pitrora Atmanaśca. Fleet reads pitror=ātmanaś ca, but prints everything up to rā as unclear. The original may have had pitroḥ Ā or pitror Ā, with a halanta form of R.
