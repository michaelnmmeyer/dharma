            <note>PS prints the two supplied segments in the same editorial markup. I assume that <foreign>ga</foreign> has been omitted, while <foreign>nāra</foreign> has been worn to illegibility. PS does not supply the lost text on 1v, so he must have had some reason to supply just these two syllables at the beginning of this line. Further, PS does not emend <foreign>-yugalaḥ</foreign> to <foreign>-yugalasya</foreign>. The text is syntactically acceptable without this emendation, but given the structure of the section, I am quite certain that a genitive was intended here.</note>

            <note>PS's reading, printed with <foreign>ṇo</foreign> in square brackets, should in principle mean that <foreign>ṇo</foreign> is unclear, but he may have wished to indicate something else. I believe the composer's intent was <foreign>saṁghaṭṭanopalabdha</foreign>, but this may require emendation if PS is correct in printing <foreign>ṭṭoṇo</foreign>.</note>
