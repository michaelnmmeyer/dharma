              <p>Halantas. Final T (e.g. line 8) resembles ta without a headmark. Final N (a fairly clear instance in l36) is probably a minuscule simplified na, raised and with a sinuous vertical tail.</p>
              <p>Original punctuation marks are single or double vertical bars. Some, especially on the first plate, have a small triangular serif on top; others are plain, while yet others are slightly sinuous and may have a small hook toward the right at the top.</p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations. The script is very elegant and ornate. Anusvāra is sometimes a dot, at other times a conspicuous circle at headline height after the character to which it belongs.PS notes that dependent ā is sometimes indicated by a vertical line on top of the character (e.g. l2, l4), while dependent ī is distinguished by a dot in the centre of the circle.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

              <note>PS notes that he does not understand this quarter of the stanza, and simply ignores both the illegible character after <foreign>ra</foreign> and the fact that the metre requires one more syllable. I restore tentatively. The illegible character may be a consonant with <foreign>ai</foreign>, but I think a badly effaced <foreign>dvī</foreign> is also plausible (compare <foreign>dvi</foreign> in the next line) and would fit the context very well. The string <foreign>asrutara</foreign>, requiring one more syllable, is open to alternative restorations, perhaps involving <foreign>āśrita</foreign> or <foreign>āsruta</foreign> (though these would be somewhat redundant with <foreign>prayātā</foreign> in the next line).</note>

              <note>This passage is definitely a stanza in a metre of the <foreign>āryā</foreign> family, but the first hemistich is much longer than it ought to be. Splitting it at this point and assuming that the bit before was meant to be introductory prose, we obtain a correct 32-mora line. However, if this was also the composer's idea, I would expect a more noticeable break at this point.</note>

              <note>I am unable to propose an emendation that would result in correct metre in the second hemistich. Reading <foreign>śatru-gaṇaḥ</foreign> at the end (instead of <foreign>śatruḥ</foreign>) would bring the mora count up to 27, so I classify the stanza as a <foreign>sugīti</foreign>, but the pattern of the fifth foot is not permissible. Emending <foreign>nr̥pati</foreign> to <foreign>nr̥patir</foreign> would yield a cleaner caesura after the third foot, but break the metre further on. If PS is correct to read <foreign>gaṇor</foreign> (see the next entry), then the original composition may have involved <foreign>guṇa-gaṇair jjitorjjita-śatruḥ</foreign>, which is prone to eyeskip, but does not yield correct metre on its own. More than one locus probably needs emendation here, but I am not able to obtain correct metre in any way. Combining the above suggestions <foreign>nr̥patir</foreign> and <foreign>guṇa-gaṇair jjitorjjita-śatruḥ</foreign> yields a 29-mora hemistich with a correct pattern in every foot, but as far as I know, 29-mora hemistichs (i.e. ones with a monomoraic sixth foot and a tetramoraic eighth) are not actually attested anywhere.</note>

              <note>The metre is again problematic, but since there is a correct <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> further on, I assume that the poet has switched to that metre and used another prose introduction before the switch. The present quarter is still hypermetrical, which may be remedied by emending to <foreign>goIndāṁbeti</foreign> or <foreign>goIndaketi</foreign>.

        <p>Although the spelling of the donated village’s name is Pulivaṟṟa in the text, I retain the established name of the grant in the normalised form Pulivaṟṟu.</p>
        <p>Assigning this grant to Amma I is highly problematic. Stanza I is attested in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates of Dānārṇava</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00052.xml">Andhra Sahitya Parishad plates of Śaktivarman</ref>, but not in any earlier plates. Stanza II is very similar to one found (with some variance) in many grants of Amma II, but the name of Amma I’s mother in the present version happens to break the metre, whereas Amma II’s mother’s name fits it.<note>Incidentally, the mother’s name is recorded as Pallava Mahādevī. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00063.xml">Velaṁbaṟṟu grant of Amma I</ref> records Amma I’s mother’s name as Lokamahādevī, which is also Amma II’s mother’s name. The Velaṁbaṟṟu grant may belong to Amma II (omitting several kings from the genealogy); or, if both Ammas had mothers named Lokamahādevī, then the present Pallava Mahādevī may be a family name rather than a personal one. However, if Amma I’s mother was really called Lokamahādevī, there would have been no reason for the composer of the present grant to change the name to Pallava and thereby ruin the metre.</note> This very strongly implies that the stanza was composed about Amma II and was clumsily adapted to describe Amma I. Stanza IV, too, occurs verbatim in multiple grants of Amma II and nowhere else. The deplorable quality of the verses describing the donee may also indicate that there is something fishy with this grant. The prose genealogy mentions Indrarāja as reigning for seven days (rather than only as the father of Viṣṇuvardhana II). This occurs in grants issued by Dānārṇava and his descendants,<note>The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00039.xml">Māṁgallu grant of Dānārṇava</ref>, the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00049.xml">Raṇastipūṇḍi grant of Vimalāditya</ref>; in garbled text, the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00078.xml">Korumelli grant of Rājarāja I</ref>; in garbled and probably corrected text, the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00079.xml">Kalidiṇḍi grant of Rājarāja I</ref>.</note> but nowhere else. The genealogy simply lists Vijayāditya II Narendramr̥garāja and his reign, whereas all known grants of Amma I that contain a full king list include a reference to Narendramr̥garāja’s 108 battles and corresponding number of temples, which is omitted from most later grants. Vijayāditya III is described here by the term <foreign>guṇagāṁka</foreign>, which is found in several grants of Amma II and one of Bādapa;<note>
the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00035.xml">Elavaṟṟu</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00043.xml">Paḷaṁkalūru</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00044.xml">Pāṁbaṟṟu</ref> and <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00045.xml">Tāṇḍikoṇḍa</ref> grants and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00046.xml">Vandram plates</ref> of Amma II, and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00030.xml">Ārumbāka grant of Bādapa</ref>.</note> earlier charters, conversely, either omit this epithet or use it (or its fuller form <foreign>guṇakkenalla</foreign>) without <foreign>aṁka</foreign>.</p>
        <p>Given the anomalies so far and given that Dānārṇava was supported by the Rāṣṭrakūṭas, it seems probable that the current grant was created in or shortly after his time, with royal approval, but set up as if it were an earlier grant issued by Amma I.<note>In spite of the stanzas adopted from descriptions of Amma II, the ostensible issuer cannot be Amma II, since stanza III uses Amma I’s epithet Gaṇḍaragaṇḍa, and lines 30-31 give his styles Sarvalokāśraya Viṣṇuvardhana.</note></p>
        <p>The name of the composer Mahākāla Bhaṭṭa is known as that of the composer of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00047.xml">Vemalūrpāḍu plates of Amma II</ref>. He may or may not be identical to Bhaṭṭa Mahākāla, composer of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00027.xml">Cevuru plates of Amma I</ref>. The latter may or may not be identical to Mahākāla, who is said in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00029.xml">Drujjūru grant of Amma I</ref> to have been a general of Bhīma I, and is granted a village by Amma I. The engraver Jontācārya (apparently written as Jāntācārya on the present plates) is the engraver of no fewer than five grants of Amma II (called Jayantācārya in one of the five) as well as of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates of Dānārṇava</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00049.xml">Raṇastipūṇḍi grant of Vimalāditya</ref>. The latter may be the same person at a venerable age or a successor, perhaps a grandson of Amma II’s and Dānārṇava’s “primary” Jontācārya. The possibility that a predecessor, perhaps a grandfather, of that Jontācārya was active in the reign of Amma I cannot be excluded, but it is more parsimonious to assume that the plates are in fact the work of the “primary” Jontācārya, who signed his name even though the plates were supposed to have been engraved before his time. The composition may be that of Mahākāla Bhaṭṭa, still active at a time; or it may belong to an anonymous author, with  Mahākāla Bhaṭṭa’s name featured in order to lend authenticity to the grant’s being of Amma I’s time.</p>
        <p>Continuing the speculative line further, once Dānārṇava was established as ruler of Veṅgī after Amma II’s death, he would not have needed such subterfuge to reward someone who had helped him. The same stands for Dānārṇava’s descendants. However, Dānārṇava first occupied the throne at the time when Amma II had fled to Kaliṅga from Kr̥ṣṇa II’s wrath after having reigned for eleven years (<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00039.xml">Māṁgallu grant of Dānārṇava</ref>), i.e. around 955 CE. At this time, as the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00039.xml">Māṁgallu grant</ref> shows, he ruled in Amma II’s name (as Vijayāditya, whereas he was Viṣṇuvardhana in his <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates</ref> issued after Amma II’s death) and had to beat around the bush explaining why he rewarded Kākatya Guṇḍyana. Backdating a grant to Amma I’s time sounds like a strategy he may well have employed at this time.</p>
        <p>As to the identity of the donee, the question certainly needs more research. PS cites and dismisses D. C. Ganguly’s opinion that he is a son of Amoghavarṣa II, and thus a grandson of Indra III (identified with Indapa I of our grant). According to PS, Amoghavarṣa II cannot have taken shelter with Amma I after being ousted by Govinda IV, because he lost his throne only in 930 CE, while Amma I’s reign ended in 927. Instead, PS suggests, the donee is Amoghavarṣa III, for which his evidence is that Amoghavarṣa III’s mother was named Govindāmbā. However, neither Amoghavarṣa III, nor his grandfather Kr̥ṣṇa II are known to have borne the name Indapa or Indra.</p>
        <p>Keeping in mind that according to our grant Indapa I was in fact the ruler of Mānyaketa (i.e. Mānyakheta), it is certainly tempting to identify him with Indra III. However, according to Altekar in <bibl>

          </bibl>, Indra III was no more than thirty years old at the time of his accession in 914 CE. That he could have had a grandson who reached adulthood<note>The grant describes him as a skilled general, which is hardly applicable to an infant or a young boy.</note> before the end of Amma I’s reign in 927 is unlikely.

          </bibl>) adds to this that since Indra III remained in power up to 927, there would have been no reason for a grandson of his to flee to Veṅgī. Then again, if our grant was actually issued by Dānārṇava, the drafters may not have bothered too much with historical accuracy. Also, there is no need to assume that flight was involved and the present grant was given in the way of alms; more likely, it is a reward for some service rendered by the donee or one of his predecessors. Given that Dānārṇava was practically a puppet of Kr̥ṣṇa III, he may well have been allied to either Amoghavarṣa III (who was Kr̥ṣṇa III’s father) or to Amoghavarṣa II (who was Kr̥ṣṇa III’s rival’s rival, ousted by Govinda IV, who was in turn ousted by Amoghavarṣa III). As pointed out above, the male names do not fit Amoghavarṣa III, while they do permit the assumption that our Indapa I was Indra III. If this is the case, then his son (not named in the grant which does, however, imply that he was a king of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas) was either Amoghavarṣa II or an unknown brother of his, and his grandson, Indapa II of the grant, is not known from other sources.</p>
