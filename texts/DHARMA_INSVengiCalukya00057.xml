              <note>I believe a spiral may be present here, but I am not sure. PS's edition has a note anchor with the number 2 after the initial word <foreign>svasti</foreign>, but note 2 of his paper is certainly not meant to go here. I think he must have intended to re-attach note 16 here. His original note 16 is attached likewise after the opening <foreign>svasti</foreign> in the first charter edited in his article, and mentions a spiral symbol at the beginning of the line.</note>

              <note>There is probably a misreading and/or scribal error here. PS in his discussion describes the teacher as <q>a follower of Aupanīya and vr̥kṣa mūla saṁgha</q>, and ignores the unintelligible /pontikalya/. However, according to the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00056.xml">Peddāpurappāḍu plates (set 1) of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, Kanakanandi was a member of the the Vr̥kṣamūla Yāpanīya <foreign>gaṇa</foreign>, and the name Yāpanīya is also attested in other Eastern Cālukya grants. I am also unable to interpret <foreign>pontikal</foreign> (is this a Tamil toponym?), but believe that <foreign>yāpanīya</foreign> must have been inscribed, or at least intended here.</note>

      <div type="commentary">
        <p>The identity of the issuer of these plates is uncertain, and the text as printed by PS is not intelligible with regard to this. According to the ARIE report, the plates were issued by a <q>Maṅgi, son of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka</q>, but the report makes no issue of the fact that no such ruler is known, and treats another set of plates, issued by Maṅgi son of Viṣṇuvardhana and grandson of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka as belonging to the same king. According to Padmanabha Sastry’s discussion, the issuer is <q>the King Bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgi mahārāja, the son of Pr̥thivīvallabha (… pr̥thivīvallabha nāmadheyasya putriṇa bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgirājan…)</q>. However, the preamble of the grant very definitely leads up to Viṣṇuvardhana II, introducing him as the grandson of Viṣṇuvardhana (I) and son of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka, then introducing him in line 8 as Viṣṇuvardhana (II) with a long list of ornamental epithets, all in the nominative. Further on, in line 11, PS prints literally, <q>upadeśa-labdhena vijñap itḥ-eva-m ājñāpayati</q>. This must surely mean that Viṣṇuvardhana II (introduced above in the nominative) commands as follows, having been petitioned (<foreign>vijñapitaḥ</foreign>) by someone who in turn heeded (<foreign>labdhena</foreign>) the religious instruction of Kanakanandi (introduced in lines 10 and 11) to do so. The problematic Maṅgi is introduced in between the two points, in lines 8 and 9. The words are printed by PS literally as follows: <q>[mu]dinī grāmau . . vī lokasya pr̥thivī-vallabha nāmadheyasya putriṇo(tro) Bhaṭṭāraka Maṅgirājaḥ</q>. If we reject the emendation of <foreign>putriṇo</foreign> (cited in his discussion as <foreign>putriṇa</foreign>) into <foreign>putro</foreign>, and instead read it as (or emend it to) <foreign>putreṇa</foreign>, then we have an instrumental here, to be picked up by <foreign>labdhena</foreign> in line 11. The only problem with this is the apparent nominative <foreign>maṅgirājaḥ</foreign>, which must then be emended to <foreign>maṅgirājena</foreign> (or an instrumental ending might be found in the unintelligible syllables read after this by PS).</p>
        <p>Thus, the grant was probably made by Viṣṇuvardhana II, on the instance of Maṅgi. The latter was probably a subordinate, perhaps related to the royal Cālukya line, or he and his father may have borne names shared with that line out of affectation. It is also possible that he is Viṣṇuvardhana II’s son, later known as Maṅgi Yuvarāja. But the title <foreign>bhaṭṭāraka</foreign> does not seem appropriate for a prince, and the manner of his introduction implies that he was the son of some other <foreign>pr̥thivī-vallabha</foreign> than Viṣṇuvardhana II.</p>
        <p>The seal legend <foreign>viṣamasiddhi</foreign> also speaks against identifying the issuer as Maṅgi Yuvarāja, and there is a final piece of independent, though circumstantial, evidence for assigning this charter to Viṣṇuvardhana II. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00056.xml">Peddāpurappāḍu plates (set 1) of Viṣṇuvardhana II</ref>, discovered together with the present plates, record a grant to presumably the very same <foreign>ācārya</foreign> Kanakanandi, and are dated (probably) in the first year of Viṣṇuvardhana II. Dating the present plates to the second year of Maṅgi Yuvarāja would separate the two grants in time (albeit only by about ten years), whereas dating them to the second year of Viṣṇuvardhana II would put them very close to one another.

          </bibl>), without facsimiles and without translation. The present edition by Dániel Balogh is based on the published edition. However, this edition contains such an inordinate number of typographic (or other) mistakes, that duplicating it to the letter would serve no purpose, and in some cases the intent of the editors cannot be reconstructed. My edition therefore shows my conjectures of what the actual reading of the plates may be and how that should in my opinion be emended. Every locus where my "reading" of the assumed original diverges from the printed edition is marked up as unclear and tentatively in my edition, whereas loci marked as unclear by the original editors are shown here as unclear, but confidently read. My apparatus cites the printed edition where I deviate from it in a major way or where my conjecture is uncertain, but I silently correct some obvious typos, ignore some nonsensical emendations, and apply my own segmentation.</p>
