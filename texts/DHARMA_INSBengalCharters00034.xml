daba siddham : Sircar (1971) and Agrawala supply +ca after saṁggohālike. Sircar (1971:248) also notes that Gulmagandhika and a plural of Saṁgohāli are also mentioned in the Kalaikuri-Sultanpur plate (IN00074). Is there any good reason for assuming that saṁgohālika is a proper name, not a local term for village or something? Compare also the toponym Śrīgohālī in the Baigram plate (IN00061), Vaṭagohālī and Nitvagohālī in the Paharpur charter (IN00065), and particularly the phrase (upari-)nirddiṣṭa-grāma-gohālikeṣu also in the Paharpur charter. The most likely solution is that gohālī means some sort of hamlet (maybe related to gośāla?), and a saṁgohālī may be a group of hamlets. (And I think I have seen someone propose that, but I don't know where.)

daba siddham :I include no emendations in this edition. Sircar's (1971 and 1973) emendations are plausible but far from certain. He suggests reading ye for ya in l3, kṣemākaḥ for kṣemāka in l4, and then mahīdāsas tair iha. Siddhanta (as quoted by Sircar 1971) emends to puṇḍravarddhaneyo, presumably also emends to kṣemākaḥ, and then mahīdāso iha.
--><!--
daba siddham :Sircar (1971:250n4) notes that Siddhanta interpreted kṣemāka as an adjective of bhoyila, meaning Śaiva. He disagrees and adds (1971:250n5) that the dual is probably used because Bhoyila and Mahīdāsa are both from the same place. He also (Sircar_1973:13) stresses that kṣemāka is not attested in lexicons as meaning Śaiva. Note, however, the persistent dual recurring in line 16 below - is it possible that there are just 2 applicants after all?

daba siddham :L14. I follow Sircar (and other editors) with upalabhya. Unfortunately none of these make clear if the asterisked akṣaras are restorations of lost text or editorial additions to make up for scribal omissions. To me the facsimile seems to read vi(jñāpya) #1# pa _1_ I certainly can't make out "mu" but my illegible character could be their clear mu. Then I see a pretty clear pa, which could be the right-hand edge of their mu plus their la. But in this case their "pa" must be an editorial addition for an omitted character. The empty space could be restored as bhya, and is probably a character lost to damage rather than a scribal omission.

daba siddham :Sircar also observes that sataka may be Sanskrit svatvaka, "proprietary right" so the phrase would mean "Nābhraka's property". Is this the etymology of satka used in later CPs? Check Sircar's glossary or somewhere.

daba siddham :Sircar and Agrawala both read samupasthitaṁ; Sircar even supplies a daṇḍa after it, while Agrawala notes that it should be emended to samupasthita-kālīyāḥ.

I see no clear anusvāra, only a faint dot above and to the right of ta, so I prefer to read samupasthita in compound with kālam, as clearly found in IN00074 (Kalaikuri plate) l28.

amwb : according to the deduction made below about Bhoyila's place of residence and the count of drona, one could deduce that these monasteries managed by Balakuṇḍa correspond to "the monastery built for the venerable Arhants in the shrine of Pecikāmrasiddhi in the Dakṣiṇāṅśaka division" and "the little peripheral monastery built for the purpose of worshipping the Arhants at Gulmagandhika".

amwb : it could be useful to indicate in a note that one can deduce from Bhoyila's place of residence (l.4) that this temple Sāmbapura corresponds to "the little peripheral monastery built for the purpose of worshipping the Arhants at Gulmagandhika" and that the other dronaparvan is allocated to "the temple built for the Lord Sahasraraśmi <supplied reason="explanation">i.e., Sūrya</supplied> in the same Gulmagandhika" ?

              <foreign>iti</foreign>
            </supplied> this land<!--
amwb: I understand that the portion of text beginning by "kṣemākabhoyilamahīdāsayo ṣaḍdroṇavāpāḥ" and finishing by "kāritam" is what is included by iti

amwb : it seems rather unlikely to me that there is an error of account in an official document whose purpose is to ratify land transactions. Therefore I understand that the plate explains how the kulyavāpa purchased with 2 dīnāra is divided into droṇavāpas. As I don't know how many droṇavāpas are contained in one kulyavāpa, my hypothesis could be faulse. But I found in Dikshit 1929-1930 that in  "five droṇavāpa =  2/3 of kulyavāpa approximately" (P.60) and "A kulya, according to various ancient authorities, was equivalent to 8 dronas=Z2 ddhakas=\29i prasthas" (p.61). According to this, one kulyavāpa is equal to 7,5 droṇavāpa at minima and regularly to 8 droṇavāpa. So by noting 7+1 the scribe certifies that the transaction is regular : 2 dinara = 1 kulyavapa = 7 drona +1 drona.
Then one can deduce that the  "droṇa-vāpan ekaṁ" near the temple (l.20) refered to the temple built for the lord Sahasraraśmi because this is the only place designated by the word "devakula" in the text. From these deductions, I suggest that this kulyavāpa purchased with 2 dīnāra consists of a sum of 7+1 :
- seven droṇavāpas situated in the Northeast of Gulmagandhikā
and one droṇavāpa near the temple built for the Lord Sahasraraśmi (which is not situated in the Northeast of Gulmagandhikā)
The repartition of the droṇavāpas is not clear at all, and in order to obtain a sum of 7+1 droṇavāpas with numbers present in the plate (6, 2 and 1), we have to assume that among the three droṇavāpas which are allocated by Bhoyila, two droṇavāpas have been bought by him alone in addition to the six droṇavāpas acquired by the three Kṣemāka, Bhoyila and Mahīdāsa. In these two droṇavāpas, one could be the one allocated to the temple built for the Lord Sahasraraśmi
