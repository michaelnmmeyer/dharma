L13. I follow Mirashi, who argues that anitya-saṁjñā-saciva means "a companion of (i.e. one mindful of) the impermanence of existence". B reads acitya-saṁjñaḥ sacivas. Bhau Daji (cited by M) read anitya-saṁjñā-saciva; Indraji (cited by M) read aciṁtya-saṁjñā-saciva. M misquotes B as reading saṁjñā, so one or both of the other two may have read saṁjñaḥ. M further claims "ni" is undoubted and the upturned curve of ā in jñā is unmistakable. Indraji's rubbing definitely shows saṁjñāḥ, sic, unless it's saṁjñiḥ - the curve could be an i as well as an ā; in fact, it seems to go a bit too far round for it to be an ā. The visarga is clear in Indraji's rubbing, but not in M's one. I'm not sure I am convinced by M's argument: saciva does look very strange in this construction. M says previous editors' understanding is problematic because "why the minister should come in abruptly here has not been stated". We don't know how the verse begins, so the minister's entry may be less abrupt than M wants us to think. I could easily imagine a minister here. samjñā may in fact be saṁjñī, or it may be a correction from saṁjñā to saṁjñaḥ (if the inscription was plastered over and painted, then it would have been easy to hide the ā mātrā without need to erase it from the stone). The name could be acitya or anitya, but other readings also seem possible. I'm in fact tempted to read it as suvidya.

I think this is a bit too much: three emendations to arrive at a forced sense. I wonder if the correct reading could be vidagdha-buddhy-āśaya. I think bu instead of va is possible on the basis of M's rubbing (though it's va in Indraji's one), and ddhy is also a possibility, or we can assume that dhy needs emendation to ddhy, as Mirashi did. My gdha is a bit of a stretch though, and my conjecture seems to want a verb (also missing from Mirashi's version). Perhaps vidur nna buddhy-āśaya? du is perhaps possible, rnna is again a bit of a stretch. But this would be sort of nice.

While the ligature truly doesn't look much like ccai, the vowel mātrā is almost certainly not i. I prefer to stay with Bühler's opinion. 
-->
          <!-- 
L25. caitya-vimāna-kalpam is my own reading of which I am far from certain. M reads caityam amāna-kalpam. Bhau Daji read caityam ihānakalpam (as cited by M, who also says Bühler read the same, which is wrong - perhaps M meant that Indraji read the same). I don't know what that means. Bühler read caityam (ahī)nakalpam (whici M also cites as being read by Bühler); his unclear markup probably means that the i mātrā is actually in the wrong place. M claims that the curve over the m (of his caityam) appears to have been cancelled, and that the following akṣara "must be read as mā. It is not hī." Now the i (not ī) mātrā over this m is quite clear in M's rubbing (though almost completely invisible in Indraji's) and I don't see any indication that it was cancelled. The next character could be ha or mā or perhaps something else, and might have an i or ī mātrā over it, placed rather to the left of where it would be expected, and perhaps struck out. I could imagine caityam ahīna-kalpam as the correct solution, but only if we assume that caityam ihānakalpam was inscribed first, and then corrected only (or mostly) by paint. Likewise, M's solution could be right, but would again need the i mātrā to be plastered/painted over, and it doesn't sound as good as B's reading. My caitya-vimāna-kalpam is a bit desperate; I'm not sure something can "resemble the vimāna of a caitya" and even if it can, we need to suppose that this something is named in the lost part of the stanza. I can also imagine reading caityam ihānukalpam, but reading hā is a stretch, and there is no trace of an u under the n.

          <!-- 
L28. B reads karmmaṇa, emending to karmaṇāṁ. But the visarga is quite certain, so M must be correct in construing this as a genitive in apposition to someone in the lost part, probably the guy who endowed the cave.

          <!-- 
L28. vāsa is my tentative reading, but I am not at all sure of it. M reads bhāva. All earlier editors had read nātha here, which M rejects, saying it is tautological and pointing at sarvvajña-bhāva-praṇidhāna-siddhi in v19 for comparison. I'm not sure tautology is grounds enough for rejection, but the second character is quite certainly not tha in M's rubbing (though it does look like tha in Indraji's). However, the first character in turn does not look like bha; it has a definite loop, so M's reading is also problematic.

L28. Not noted by previous editors, there is something between sa and mpadaḥ; it looks like a double daṇḍa in Indraji's rubbing, but may be a bit more complex based on M's rubbing - perhaps śu or gu. It is definitely superfluous.

L29. M reads vihanti, as did Bhau Daji. Indraji and Bühler read nihanti. M calls this a misreading. Indraji's rubbing definitely shows ni, while M's does look more like vi, but there is no way to reject ni on its basis so I keep the ambiguity.

          <!-- 
L29. The closer sign, transliterated by B as Oṁ and completely ignored by M, looks rather like an opening maṅgala symbol, with a short dextrorse spiral at the right and a more or less horizontal tail at the left, bending slightly up (so all in all, much like a question mark mirrored and then rotated 90° clockwise).
