This edition is based on Altekar_1941-42 (A) and Banerjee_1944 (B), only referring to Thaplyal (Th) when he differs from Altekar. 
--><lb n="1"/><g type="mangala"/> mahārājādhirāja-parameśvara-śrī-viṣṇugupta-deva-pravarddhamāna-vijaya-rājya<!-- 
L1. The mangala symbol looks like a question mark without a dot. 
--><lb break="no" n="2"/>-samvatsare saptadaśe samvaT <num value="17"><g type="numeral">10</g> 7</num> śrāvaṇa śudi <num value="2">2</num> cundaskīlā-tapovana<!-- 
L2. The halanta T of samvat is unusual. Altekar points to the halanta N in l7 for comparison and notes that here to one would expect a virāma symbol below the letter. Instead, the halanta T is formed by omitting the headmark of ta. Altekar had initially (Journal of Numismatic Society of India, 1941, p57) read it as 100, but subsequently rejected this reading. 
--><!-- 
L2. The line ends a bit early, and there is something in the space after na, but this is most likely just an ornamental extension of the e of ane in the next line. 
--><lb break="no" n="3"/>-pratiṣṭhita-śrī-mittra-keśava-deva-prati<sic>v</sic>addha-puṣpa-paṭṭe sva-siddhāntābhirata<supplied reason="omitted">ḥ</supplied> Ane<!-- 
L3. A reads/prints mitra; B, correctly, mittra. 
--><!-- 
L3. A (and Th) emends to °rato 'neka, which is of course correct. B prints °rata-taneka, which doesn't make much sense. I prefer the less invasive emendation shown here, following the model of °ajjaḥ aṅgāra in l5. 
--><lb break="no" n="4"/>ka-śiva-siddhāyatana-tīrthāvagāhana-pavittrī-kr̥ta-tanuḥ kuṭukka-deśī<!-- 
L4. Th, for some reason, prints °vagāhya instead of °vagāhana. Probably a typo, since he does not note that A (and B) read differently 
--><!-- 
L4. I follow A in reading kuṭukka. B reads kuṭṭukka, but compare kuṭumbin in l5: this is definitely ṭu. A believes the word may be a mistake for kukkuṭa, which he then (very tenuously, in my opinion) identifies as the region around Gayā. 
--><lb break="no" n="5"/>ya<supplied reason="omitted">ḥ</supplied> Avimuktajjaḥ Aṅgāra-grāmake sakala-kuṭum<sic>v</sic>ināṁ sakāśād ācandrā<!-- 
L5. A (and Th) emends to °deśīyo 'vimuktajjo 'ṅgāra. I prefer to keep avimuktajjaḥ and emend deśīya on the model of that, as above in l3. 
--><!-- 
L5. B reads avimuktajñaḥ (incorrectly quoted in Thaplyal as avimuktajñāḥ). Avimuktajja (=avimuktārya) is far more likely. 
--><lb break="no" n="6"/>rka-kṣiti-samakālīnaṁ tailasya palam ekam upakrīya bhagavataḥ<!-- 
L6. As A notes, the anusvāra of kālīnaṁ is not above na, but at headline height after na. Not noted by A, this is probably because the ī of lī extends over na. 
--><lb n="7"/>śrī-subhadreś<unclear>v</unclear>ara-devasya pradīpārthaṁ pratipāditavāN|| Evaṁ yo nyathā<!-- 
L7. The halanta N is formed of a regular na and a mark under it just like a modern virāma sign. 
--><!-- 
L7. The punctuation mark is a plain double vertical. 
--><!-- 
L8. 
--><lb n="8"/>karoti yad attr<unclear>ā</unclear>pāyaṁ<unclear>ttāvad a</unclear>vāpnotīti||<!-- 
L8. For the problematic bit, A: yad attrāpāyaṁstanadavāpnotīti; Th: yad attrapayaṁstanadavāpnotīti (his pa is probably a typo); B: yad attrāpāyan tāvad avāpnotīti. A's comment on this: "Here the text is defective and its restoration is not free from difficulty. The neuter yad would sugget that the expression pāpaṁ should follow; the reading -tr=āpāyaṁ is howerer clear and so it appears that the word apāya was also before the mind of the composer. If, however, we prefer to read this word, we shall have to change yad into yo. The letter sta following yaṁ seems to be a mistake of the engraver for sa; we want a saḥ to correspond with yaḥ coming earlier. The next letter looks like na, but it is to be corrected into ta. The succeeding letter is less likely to be ma than da, with an unnecessary stroke to its right, caused by the slipping of the instrument. The restoration therefore should be yad=atra pāpaṁ sa tad=avāpnoti; the emendation yo=tr=āpāyas=sa tam=avāpnoti is less likely to have been intended by the composer." My observations: 1. ttrā is far from certain; what looks like an ā mātrā is inline, not overhead like most (all?) ā mātrās in the inscription, yet there is nothing above the character that could push an ā out of its regular place. 2. sta (which A wants to emend to sa) is also uncertain, the top looks mor like t, possibly n (as read by B); less like s. 3. The next character definitely looks like va (as per B), not like na (compare e.g. the end of this line). 4. I agree with A that the next one is probably da, with an extra stroke at the top right. I wonder if the intent might have been yad attra pāpaṁ tat tāvad avāpnoti (i.e. supply an omitted ta and assume that the ya is meant to be pa). 
--><!-- 
L8. The vowel marks on tī and, particularly, ti are large and ornamental, as a sort of indication that the substance of the inscription ends here. 
--><!-- 
L8. The punctuation mark is a double vertical; there may additionally be a horizontal mark before it.
