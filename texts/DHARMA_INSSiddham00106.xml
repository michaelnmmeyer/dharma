The mangala symbol looks like a ? (without the dot) rotated 90° clockwise. It is clear in Kuwayama's rubbing. Tucci transcribes it as oṁ without noting that it's a symbol.
--><!--
Tucci reads (j)ikṣe. Nakatani in Kuwayama reads rikṣe, which is indeed more probable. The consonant is definitely not j, though it is also not a proper r. But see bhaṭṭāraka in l2 for a comparably shaped r.
--><!--
Tucci reads/restores citrakarmma at the l1/l2 boundary. This is very unlikely in view of Kuwayama's rubbing. Nakatani reads (citrak)e, which he probably translates as "zodiacal sign" (his translation is very verbose). But the traces at the end of l1 don't look like tra at all (and even less like ttra, which we'd expect). I think nha (for cinhake = cihnake; cihna is attested for zodiacal sign in Br̥hatsaṁhitā) is possible, but prefer to leave the character as illegible. Note in addition that the preceding character may be vi as well as ci, and the first character in line 2 could be just about anything, though Nakatani is probably correct in seeing an e mātrā, and k is plausible.
--><!--
Sircar suggets emending mahā-vināyaka to mahā-vināyaka-bimbaṁ. This is only to provide a subject in the neuter.
--><!--
Nakatani reads bhaṭṭeraka and Kuwayama notes this as one of the mistakes of the engraver. This is incorrect; the character is definitely ṭṭā in the rubbing, but ā is attached to ṭ in this form.
--><!--
Tucci reads khiṁgala, Sircar and Nakatani prefer khiṁgāla. The latter seems more likely from the photo and rubbing, though the apparent ā mātrā is a bit atrophied.
--><!--
Tucci reads otyāna, remarking that it could also be odyāna or oḍyāna, trying to link it to the name Uḍḍiyāna for the Swat valley. Sircar and Nakatani deem au certain (probably correct; it is not impossible that the left stroke is part of the consonant l, but the subscript l of śukla does not have it). Sircar accepts tyā and believes ta more likely than na at the end, but he notes that the readings aunyāna, aunyāta and autyāna "cannot be regarded as altogether impossible". Nakatani reads auḍyāna, which I accept; ḍ with a spike on the left, instead of a curve, is not unheard of.
--><!--
Sircar describes the closing symbol as a floral design; all I see in the photo is a number of curving lines. I cannot make out a visarga before it either.
