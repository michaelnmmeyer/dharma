The space at the beginning of l1 is clearly to leave room for dr̥ṣṭam.
--><!--
The halanta Ṭ in l4 is a small subscript character.
--><!--
Mirashi prints the first sū in l5 as unclear. Kielhorn notes that it is clear in the original. To me it seems pretty clear in both facsimiles, except that the length-marker of ū does not seem to be attached to the hook.
--><!--
Line 9 is squeezed with difficulty into the bottom of the plate, with several small spaces (not marked in the edition) where characters hang down from l8, and some spots where the upper components of l9 characters tangle with l8.
--><!--
There is no apparent explanation for the space in l10. Mirashi sees a redundant visarga in this space, but I don't and neither did Kielhorn.
--><!--
The subscript m of "°m mahārāja" in l10 may be a subsequent correction, since it is squeezed into very little vertical space, as if l11 had already been engraved when it was written.
--><!--
At the same spot, before mahārāja in l10, the sequence "mahārāja-śrī-bhavanāga-dauhitrasya gautamīputrasya putrasya vākāṭakānām" is missing, as noted by both Kielhorn and Mirashi.
--><!--
Note the unusual doubling of ṣ after r in l14.
--><!--
I see no explanation for the first space in l17
--><!--
Line 18 is again squeezed into little space at the bottom; it begins below "viṣe" in l17.
--><!--
Visargas in this inscription vary, but they generally have longer strokes for at least the bottom dot, sometimes for both. The longer strokes look like the letter J (without a serif) rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

Mirashi prints an upadhmānīya in śambhoḥ pra° in l24, but the inscription has a visarga (printed correctly by Kielhorn).
--><!--
Mirashi sees the redundant punctuation sign in l25 (a long horizontal) as "an incomplete sign of a redundant initial i". Kielhorn believes "some akshara (perhaps the initial i) was engraved, but has been erased." I believe a punctuation sign is much more likely. (Interestingly, there is another - very similar - redundant punctuation mark in l33, which Mirashi transcribes as a daṇḍa, while Kielhorn says "Here again there is a mark which looks like part of a visarga"; I don't think his "again" could refer to anything other than this mark in l25.)
--><!--
For mahārājja in l25, Mirashi just prints mahārāja, probably a typo since he corrects this ja to ja. Kielhorn, correctly, has jja.
--><!--
I transcribe the beginning of l27 as it appears (except that (?vi) looks like bha [or possibly a damaged śa] to me, but Kielhorn avers that vi is "distinctly visible" in the original). Previous editors agree on śvā, though Kielhorn expresses some uncertainty about it; it could also be śmā or perhaps ścā and may have been corrected to or from something else. The next character looks like yā, which Kielhorn admits but Mirashi does not mention, reading it as (?sā). This too may have been corrected. Neither Kielhorn nor Mirashi include the M in their editions, though both mention it in a note; Kielhorn adds that it "has probably been struck out", of which I see no indication in the facsimile. Neither editor mentions the space after M. Both ultimately read (emend to) viśvāsād apahr̥ta (Mirashi translates: "who, from confidence in the excellent qualities previously acquired by him, took away the (royal) fortune of (his) family".) I believe they may be wrong. These characters appear much clumsier than the rest of the inscription and are almost certainly a later addition. I think l27 began with dapahr̥ta, just as l18 also begins with quite a large indent. To make sense of dapahr̥ta, I believe we should read guṇā at the end of l26, which seems possible from the facsimile (though less likely in the plate in EI than in Shastri's plate). The string viśvāyāM (or whatever) is probably meant to be an addition to another part of the text - so come back to this: can I find where? And maybe change guṇā in the edition (and adjust the lb tag to break). One more thing that occurs to me: this could perhaps be viṣṭhāyāM, though the top of the second character doesn't really look like ṣ. But one could plausibly believe that one of the [hypothetical] subsequent plates included the verse about worms in faeces, and this word was omitted from there and scrawled at the bottom of this page. This, then, would mean that the plates may not be unfinished after all. Furthermore, #Shastri_1975-76b:172-173 proposes a correction on the basis of #IN00190 and wishes to read pūrvvādhigata-guṇavad-dāyādāpahr̥ta, saying "There is absolutely no doubt" about it. I should return to this and consider. From this plate, va is easily possible, ddā is very unlikely, even if Shastri thinks it "is actually wrongly engraved ddā with its right openings closed by oversight". yā is almost certainly correct. For the following halanta M, Shastri thinks it is a letter "wrongly engraved and then cancelled", which isn't very convincing. Finally, Shastri agrees that the next character is da, but apparently he wants to emend it to dā.
--><!--
Mirashi omits the va of vaṅśa in l27, a typo.
--><!--
In l28, Kielhorn notes that perhaps the inscription actually has maikalā; Mirashi just reads mekalā without a note. I think maikalā is quite clear.
--><!--
I retain Mirashi's emendation of °adhipatibhir in l28. Kielhorn emends to adhipaty-. The same problematic reading occurs in IN00190:18 Mirashi's solution seems better but I keep wondering. Perhaps the intent was, instead, adhipater? Possibly using the genitive as a sort of wildcard in place of an instrumental? (the singular, though, is not nice) And perhaps °apahr̥ta-vaṅśa-śriyaḥ actually agrees with this rather than with Narendrasena? And to take it even further, perhaps we should read/emend viśvāsād in l27 after all, but take that as the cause of these rulers' abhyarcana? They embraced his rule because their dynasties had declined and they had faith in Narendrasena's previously perceived qualities? This sounds like a good narrative, but is pretty difficult to get from the text.
--><!--
Mirashi prints the i of abhyarccita in l28 as original; Kielhorn prints it as an emendation. I see a faint curve above the r which I take to be trace of an original i.
--><!--
In l29 I accept the emendation proposed both by Kielhorn and Mirashi.
--><!--
Both Kielhorn and Mirashi read sannidhāna in l32, but the plate clearly has saṇṇidhāna.
--><!--
For dvimagna in l33, both Kielhorn and Mirashi tentatively offer the emendation nimagna. While this makes sense, dvi instead of ni looks like an unlikely mistake. Could this mean "the doubly fallen dynasty" or "the twice fallen dynasty" (reading dvi as standing for dvir)? It fell once before and was raised by someone, then it fell once again and was raised by Pr̥thivīṣeṇa?
--><!--
Kielhorn avers that the halanta T of vacanāT in l35 "is really visible in the original plates" though "very small". I accept his testimony. Mirashi prints the T as supplied, which would be in line with standard Vākāṭaka practice.
