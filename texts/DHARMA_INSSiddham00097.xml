</lg><!--
L5. F reads vināmya and SI follows suit. The stone has vinamya; there is definitely no vowel mark to the right of n. There is damage above n, but a śiromātrā for n is unlikely to begin with, and if there had been one, it should have been attached to the right-hand tip of the headmark, where a trace should be visible but isn't. Vināmya must still have been the intent, though according to SI the use of vināmya instead of vinamayya is "not grammatically happy".
--><!--
L5. Fleet (CII3) holds Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana to be two different people, translating janendra as "tribal ruler" and narādhipati as "king of men". Hoernle_1889:96 takes them to be the same, translating both janendra and narādhipati as "tribal chieftain" and arguing that this was Yaśodharman's original title, but he then became an emperor and took the name Viṣṇuvardhana and the titles rājādhirāja and parameśvara. Fleet_1890:227 reacts to this saying he has no special reason to urge against this view, but cannot accept it before further consideration, because of "the apparently pointed contrast of janêndra ... with narâdhipati", the use of punaś ca, and the use of sa eva which he says should be sa eṣa if the two were identical. I disagree with the first and the third, but the second, punaś ca, is indeed strange. (Is it perhaps used because Hoernle is right and the two verses describe two stages in his life?) On a different note, BhandarkarRG_1902:392 supposes that Viṣṇuvardhana was an ancestor of Yaśodharman, the first of his house who rose to emperorhood. Hoernle_1903:550n1 counters Fleet saying sa eva actually affirms that the two are the same, and their styles are not official titles like mahārāja but "synonymic descriptions of sovereignty or chiefship." SI leans toward identity, stressing the use of sa eva and the facts that Mandsaur was YD's capital and the engraver was an officer of YD as per IN00094:9.

L5. Note the initial au.
--><!--
L5. Fleet (1888:151 and 151-152n4) translates "aulikara-crest", proposing hot-rayed or cool-rayed to interpret aulikara, and insists that lāñchana is a sigil used on copper seals and is distinct from the dhvajas of rulers. Sircar (SI 413n3) summarises Fleet and seems to concur except for noting that for some dynasties the lāñchana and dhvaja was the same and for adding that Aulikara was Yaśodharman's family name. I would go further and simply translate lāñchana as "name" here, though that meaning is only found in lexicons according to MW.

<l n="d">rājanvanto ramante bhuja-vijita-bhuvā bhūrayo yena deśāḥ||</l><!--
L8. The ye of yena is not the standard form, with a full looped tripartite y and a vowel mark on top. This one has just a low-lying loop at the bottom left, and the e mātrā extends horizontally from the top of the central vertical. The reason for the variant form is probably the extravagant o mātrā on the preceding yo. (Or it could simply be an alternative form for ye with a pr̥ṣṭhamātrā instead of śiromātrā.)

L9. Fleet actually reads dhūmareṇa here. The reading dhūsareṇa was probably first proposed (apparently as an emendation) in Durgaprasad_Parab_1892 and approved by Kielhorn_1891 (Kielhorn_1891 seems to be in fact later than Durgaprasad_Parab_1892). Ma and sa can look very similar in the inscription, but this one is certainly sa.

<l n="d">paryyāvr̥tta-śikhaṇḍi-candraka Iva dhyāmaṁ raver mmaṇḍalaM||<!--
L9. Fleet and Sircar both print paryā, but this must be a typo; the reading is paryyā.
--><!--
L9. The halanta M at the end of v9 occupies no horizontal space, being between and below la and the punctuation mark, in line with the subscript y of tasya. It may be a subsequent addition, but I believe it is more likely to be a calligraphic choice. See also line 11.

L10. F translates vasīyān as very excellent. SI concurs and gives this meaning in a footnote. Since we are now quite sure they were indeed a merchant family, perhaps vasīyān simply means "very rich".
--><!--
L10. F gives the six enemies as desire, wrath, covetousness, bewilderment, pride and envy. SI provides the Sanskrit: kāmakrodhas tathā lobho madamohau ca matsaraḥ.
-->
<l n="d">Āsīd vasīyān kila ṣaṣṭhidattaḥ||</l><!--
L10. The la of kila has a stem extended upward and ending in a blade ornament like vowel marks. Compare e.g. saṁlakṣyate in l9 for a regular la.

L11. The halanta M at the end of v11 occupies no horizontal space, being between and below the ā of nā and the hook of the punctuation mark. It may be a subsequent addition, but I believe it is more likely to be a calligraphic choice. See also line 9 above.

L11. Note that v13 is obviously meant to be a śleṣa with the mountain and the family both being described in the first two quarters.

L11. The l of mūlaṁ is again vertically extended.
--><!--
L12. Here too the halanta M seems to double as a punctuation mark.
-->
<l n="c">guru śikharam ivādres tat-kulaṁ svātma-bhūtyā</l><!--
L12. Fleet and Sircar both print guru-śikharam with a hyphen, but I see no need for a compound here; śikhara in the sense of peak is attested in both masculine and neuter according to MW.
--><!--
L12. I construe tat-kulaṁ as a tatpuruṣa, assuming that Ravikīrti was an outsider such as a poet patronised by the family. (Bhāravi?) Tatpuruṣa is also good if Ravikīrti was Varāhadāsa's son or brother, but if Ravikīrti was Varāhadāsa by another name, then tat kulam as separate words is better.

<l n="d">kalāv api kulīnatā||<!--
L13. Fleet reads visaṁbvā at the end of the line and corrects to visaṁva, where the final a must be a typo. In any case, I consider saṁbvā an unlikely mistake to make, whereas saṁvvā is quite natural (compare saṁvvat, which is a fairly common spelling). The upper character of the ligature does indeed look rather boxy, but so do some definite v-s (compare e.g. IvādhvarāN and vartmasu in l13), and this character has a headmark, while b does not. So I read it as a slightly malformed v.

-->
<l n="c">bhānuguptā tataḥ sādhvī</l>
<l n="d">tanayāṁs trīn ajījanaT||</l><!--
L13. Interestingly, the halanta T character has a curl at the bottom right, resembling an u mātrā. Can this be an early form of the modern virāma? The T itself is larger than before and it is not as deeply subscript, but nor is it a regular ta plus the curl. Also, note that the double punctuation sign is not replaced by the halanta character.

<l n="d">andhakānām ivoddhavaḥ||</l><!--
L14. Neither Fleet nor Sircar comment on Uddhava and the Andhakas. From Mani's Puranic Encyclopaedia: the Andhakas seem to be the Yādavas (named after Andhaka, a famous descendant of Yadu and ancestor of Kr̥ṣṇa). Uddhava was a disciple of Br̥haspati [hence an excellent minister] (MBh Ādiparvan 220.30 according to Vettam Mani, 213.26 in etext, ... uddhavaś ca mahāyaśāḥ| sākṣād br̥haspateḥ śiṣyo mahābuddhir mahāyaśāḥ). Moreover, Uddhava was the son of Devabhāga (Harivaṁśa 24.25, uddhavo devabhāgasya mahābhāgaḥ suto 'bhavat), who in turn is the brother of Vasudeva, father of Kr̥ṣṇa (Hariv. 24.22-15). For Uddhava as minister to Yadus, see also Harivaṁśa Appendix I.31.98, ... uddhavaṁ nītimattaram | yasya nītiṁ samāśritya jīvanti yadavaḥ sukham ||. Where I am getting at with this: is this an indication that the Naigamas not only served as dynastic ministers to the Aulikaras, but also intermarried with them? In Fleet's translation "the prop of his relatives in the paths of religious actions" is very neutral. Since Uddhava's claim to fame was his excellence as a minister, and since his kings were his relatives, I don't think this stanza is simply about Doṣa being nice to his poorer relatives.

L14. Fleet takes v18ab as a description of Abhayadatta but I wonder, isn't this rather still about Doṣa? Also, I think his mental eyes followed the eyes of his (actual) spies, while Fleet translates "whose eye of intellect, which served him like the eyes of a spy" [so does he translate anugantr̥ as "imitating" or does he disregard that word?]. Fleet also, for some reason, takes dharitryām with padam udayi dadhāno, though I think it should obviously go with na ... asti ... adr̥ṣṭaṁ. Kielhorn (in #Fleet_1889:220) also pointed this out, and so does Sircar.

L16. Fleet restores cinvan, translating "collecting (in order to dispel it) the fear of (his) subjects(?)". Kielhorn (in #Fleet_1889:220) suggests vighnan instead, which Sircar adopts. I follow. I think vi is a bit more likely than ci, and vi-han is attested (e.g. MBh) in the sense of "ward off." Nothing of the second character is visible in the rubbing, photo or the original stone: this is lost completely. The n prefixed to pra is a bit uncertain, but almost clear in the original; also note that the p part is clearly below where it should be: the left-hand stem is full height, but the right-hand stem ends about midline, which shows that there is another consonant before it. In the rubbing, most of pra is indistinct, but there is a credible impression of a prefixed n.

L16. There seems to be a short, commalike, almost-vertical line at the very end of the line. It is distinct from the anusvāra of idānīṁ below and probably functions as a space filler because ddhyā does not reach the margin (since it had to be shifted left to accommodate nīṁ below).

L17. The character rṇṇā is peculiar: not only the ā mātrā, but the repha too is attached to the right-hand side of the character. Still, Fleet and Sircar must be correct in reading rṇṇā rather than just ṇṇā; compare ṇā in l9 and l23. Note however that rṇṇi in this line has a regular repha. The reason for this strange shape may be plu above, which hangs down very far, almost to the top right of the ṇṇ ligature.

L19. Fleet translates "as a bull carries a wrinkled pendulous dew-lap", noting that bāhuleya is not found in dictionaries in the sense of "bull" but the meaning was explained to him by Pandit Durga Prasad of Jaipur. It makes good sense. Sircar adds that bāhuleya is from bahulā, "cow" - though this meaning, according to MW, is only found in lexicons. (Note also the use of bāleya for donkey above.) SI also adds a footnote saying balin = weighty, but his text still has valinam. The reading is definitely valinam, and I think it is much more likely derived from vali, wrinkle, than from bala.

L19. Kielhorn_1891 proposes reading jñāti instead of jāti here, saying there may be traces of a subscript ñ here. Fleet translates "Daksha,-invested with the decoration of the protection of friends, as if he were (his) broad-shouldered (right) arm (decorated) with choice jewels". Kielhorn says there is no authority for understanding jāti-ratna as "choice jewel" and proposes to translate (reading jñāti): "His dexterous younger brother, by excellent relatives invested, as with a decoration, with the protection of friends, - being as it were (Dharmadôsha's) broad-shouldered arm, to which excellent relatives had fastened a beneficial ornament to guard (against evil)". The idea sounds good, but the reading is out of the question, there is nothing below jā.

L19-20. I'm not sure about the names here. Fleet takes Dakṣa to be the proper name of the brother, but also says he bore the name of "the faultless one." See also v28 at the end, where again Fleet takes Dakṣa as a name and nirdoṣa as a common adjective, while I'd much rather take these the other way round. Kielhorn_1891 believes the name is Nirdoṣa. Salomon takes both Dakṣa and Nirdoṣa as his name. Given all the other doṣas in the family, perhaps Nirdoṣa is more likely to be his primary name and dakṣa an established epithet. However, I still think it is possible that, Mudrārākṣasa-wise, the name nirdoṣa has political overtones, and this guy may have betrayed his royal family and later repented and been pardoned. This may even be implied in the phrasing which introduces him as Dakṣa, then says that he built the well while he was bearing the gladdening name Nirdoṣa (i.e. after he was granted a royal pardon, which made him understandably happy). The name of his uncle Abhayadatta may be similarly loaded.

L22. F reads bhāra-mandraś, translating "sounding low on account of the burden (that they carry)." Sircar keeps Fleet's reading but I am quite (though not fully) certain it is in fact tāra, and the sound is high and low-pitched, probably two separate sounds from bhr̥ṅga and ali (which Fleet simply translates together as bees, but which more probably are carpenter bees and honeybees). The only problem is that the qualifiers are in an inverted order.

L23. Fleet reads rāmayan, without any indication of uncertainty. Kielhorn_1891 proposes reading kampayan, noting the unclear text and pointing out that we need a verb that makes sense with kisalaya as well as with mānasa. Sircar adopts kampayan, showing it as clear. In the original stone, ra and ma are completely clear, though the ā of rā is not. A faint line resembling a crossbar (which would make k instead of r) is decidedly shallower and narrower than the engraved strokes, so it must be damage. There is also a bit of damage below ma, but it does not seem extensive enough to obliterate a subscript p. As to Kielhorn's problem that we need a doubly applicable meaning, I feel it can be dismissed by assuming that it "caresses" the twig and "comforts" the mind of the ladies.

The reading °yāsa° was probably first proposed (apparently as an emendation) in Durgaprasad_Parab_1892 and approved by Kielhorn_1891 (Kielhorn_1891 seems to be in fact later than Durgaprasad_Parab_1892). The ā mātrā (an upright one) is definitely discernible, though not entirely clear, in the original stone; it is not an anusvāra.
