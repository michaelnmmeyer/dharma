L5. F reads vināmya and SI follows suit. The stone has vinamya; there is definitely no vowel mark to the right of n. There is damage above n, but a śiromātrā for n is unlikely to begin with, and if there had been one, it should have been attached to the right-hand tip of the headmark, where a trace should be visible but isn't. Vināmya must still have been the intent, though according to SI the use of vināmya instead of vinamayya is "not grammatically happy". 
-->
        <!-- 
L5. Fleet (CII3) holds Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana to be two different people, translating janendra as "tribal ruler" and narādhipati as "king of men". Hoernle_1889:96 takes them to be the same, translating both janendra and narādhipati as "tribal chieftain" and arguing that this was Yaśodharman's original title, but he then became an emperor and took the name Viṣṇuvardhana and the titles rājādhirāja and parameśvara. Fleet_1890:227 reacts to this saying he has no special reason to urge against this view, but cannot accept it before further consideration, because of "the apparently pointed contrast of janêndra ... with narâdhipati", the use of punaś ca, and the use of sa eva which he says should be sa eṣa if the two were identical. I disagree with the first and the third, but the second, punaś ca, is indeed strange. (Is it perhaps used because Hoernle is right and the two verses describe two stages in his life?) On a different note, BhandarkarRG_1902:392 supposes that Viṣṇuvardhana was an ancestor of Yaśodharman, the first of his house who rose to emperorhood. Hoernle_1903:550n1 counters Fleet saying sa eva actually affirms that the two are the same, and their styles are not official titles like mahārāja but "synonymic descriptions of sovereignty or chiefship." SI leans toward identity, stressing the use of sa eva and the facts that Mandsaur was YD's capital and the engraver was an officer of YD as per IN00094:9.

L5. Fleet (1888:151 and 151-152n4) translates "aulikara-crest", proposing hot-rayed or cool-rayed to interpret aulikara, and insists that lāñchana is a sigil used on copper seals and is distinct from the dhvajas of rulers. Sircar (SI 413n3) summarises Fleet and seems to concur except for noting that for some dynasties the lāñchana and dhvaja was the same and for adding that Aulikara was Yaśodharman's family name. I would go further and simply translate lāñchana as "name" here, though that meaning is only found in lexicons according to MW.

L8. The ye of yena is not the standard form, with a full looped tripartite y and a vowel mark on top. This one has just a low-lying loop at the bottom left, and the e mātrā extends horizontally from the top of the central vertical. The reason for the variant form is probably the extravagant o mātrā on the preceding yo. (Or it could simply be an alternative form for ye with a pr̥ṣṭhamātrā instead of śiromātrā.)

L12. I construe tat-kulaṁ as a tatpuruṣa, assuming that Ravikīrti was an outsider such as a poet patronised by the family. (Bhāravi?) Tatpuruṣa is also good if Ravikīrti was Varāhadāsa's son or brother, but if Ravikīrti was Varāhadāsa by another name, then tat kulam as separate words is better.

L13. Fleet reads visaṁbvā at the end of the line and corrects to visaṁva, where the final a must be a typo. In any case, I consider saṁbvā an unlikely mistake to make, whereas saṁvvā is quite natural (compare saṁvvat, which is a fairly common spelling). The upper character of the ligature does indeed look rather boxy, but so do some definite v-s (compare e.g. IvādhvarāN and vartmasu in l13), and this character has a headmark, while b does not. So I read it as a slightly malformed v.

L14. Neither Fleet nor Sircar comment on Uddhava and the Andhakas. From Mani's Puranic Encyclopaedia: the Andhakas seem to be the Yādavas (named after Andhaka, a famous descendant of Yadu and ancestor of Kr̥ṣṇa). Uddhava was a disciple of Br̥haspati [hence an excellent minister] (MBh Ādiparvan 220.30 according to Vettam Mani, 213.26 in etext, ... uddhavaś ca mahāyaśāḥ| sākṣād br̥haspateḥ śiṣyo mahābuddhir mahāyaśāḥ). Moreover, Uddhava was the son of Devabhāga (Harivaṁśa 24.25, uddhavo devabhāgasya mahābhāgaḥ suto 'bhavat), who in turn is the brother of Vasudeva, father of Kr̥ṣṇa (Hariv. 24.22-15). For Uddhava as minister to Yadus, see also Harivaṁśa Appendix I.31.98, ... uddhavaṁ nītimattaram | yasya nītiṁ samāśritya jīvanti yadavaḥ sukham ||. Where I am getting at with this: is this an indication that the Naigamas not only served as dynastic ministers to the Aulikaras, but also intermarried with them? In Fleet's translation "the prop of his relatives in the paths of religious actions" is very neutral. Since Uddhava's claim to fame was his excellence as a minister, and since his kings were his relatives, I don't think this stanza is simply about Doṣa being nice to his poorer relatives.

L14. Fleet takes v18ab as a description of Abhayadatta but I wonder, isn't this rather still about Doṣa? Also, I think his mental eyes followed the eyes of his (actual) spies, while Fleet translates "whose eye of intellect, which served him like the eyes of a spy" [so does he translate anugantr̥ as "imitating" or does he disregard that word?]. Fleet also, for some reason, takes dharitryām with padam udayi dadhāno, though I think it should obviously go with na ... asti ... adr̥ṣṭaṁ. Kielhorn (in #Fleet_1889:220) also pointed this out, and so does Sircar.

L16. Fleet restores cinvan, translating "collecting (in order to dispel it) the fear of (his) subjects(?)". Kielhorn (in #Fleet_1889:220) suggests vighnan instead, which Sircar adopts. I follow. I think vi is a bit more likely than ci, and vi-han is attested (e.g. MBh) in the sense of "ward off." Nothing of the second character is visible in the rubbing, photo or the original stone: this is lost completely. The n prefixed to pra is a bit uncertain, but almost clear in the original; also note that the p part is clearly below where it should be: the left-hand stem is full height, but the right-hand stem ends about midline, which shows that there is another consonant before it. In the rubbing, most of pra is indistinct, but there is a credible impression of a prefixed n.

It makes good sense. Sircar adds that bāhuleya is from bahulā, "cow" - though this meaning, according to MW, is only found in lexicons. (Note also the use of bāleya for donkey above.) SI also adds a footnote saying balin = weighty, but his text still has valinam. The reading is definitely valinam, and I think it is much more likely derived from vali, wrinkle, than from bala.

L19-20. I'm not sure about the names here. Fleet takes Dakṣa to be the proper name of the brother, but also says he bore the name of "the faultless one." See also v28 at the end, where again Fleet takes Dakṣa as a name and nirdoṣa as a common adjective, while I'd much rather take these the other way round. Kielhorn_1891 believes the name is Nirdoṣa. Salomon takes both Dakṣa and Nirdoṣa as his name. Given all the other doṣas in the family, perhaps Nirdoṣa is more likely to be his primary name and dakṣa an established epithet. However, I still think it is possible that, Mudrārākṣasa-wise, the name nirdoṣa has political overtones, and this guy may have betrayed his royal family and later repented and been pardoned. This may even be implied in the phrasing which introduces him as Dakṣa, then says that he built the well while he was bearing the gladdening name Nirdoṣa (i.e. after he was granted a royal pardon, which made him understandably happy). The name of his uncle Abhayadatta may be similarly loaded.

Sircar adopts kampayan, showing it as clear. In the original stone, ra and ma are completely clear, though the ā of rā is not. A faint line resembling a crossbar (which would make k instead of r) is decidedly shallower and narrower than the engraved strokes, so it must be damage. There is also a bit of damage below ma, but it does not seem extensive enough to obliterate a subscript p. As to Kielhorn's problem that we need a doubly applicable meaning, I feel it can be dismissed by assuming that it "caresses" the twig and "comforts" the mind of the ladies.
