  <note>Two verbs have been left out, one in the third person singular after

  <foreign>maṇḍapa</foreign>, from which it has been derived, in the sense of the 
  <foreign>māṇḍavī</foreign>, 'custom house'—see Molesworth, Marāṭhī Dictionary, sub voce. The 
  <foreign>śaulkika</foreign>s are frequently mentioned in Sanskrit inscriptions.</note> prefects of countries and others, to the freeholders of various villages,
  <note>That 
  <foreign>bhojaka</foreign> does not mean' temple priest,' but 'ināmdār,' or 'freeholder,' seems to follow from its use in line 8, where the donees are called 
  <foreign>cillarekakoḍumkabhojaka</foreign>s, who lived in Āpiṭṭī, and in line 50, where the privy councillor Bhaṭṭisama receives the title 
  <foreign>kolivālabhojake</foreign>. Such a despised personage as a temple priest could hardly become a minister. Professor Fausböll points out to me that 
  <foreign>gāmāgāmabhojaka</foreign> may be rendered as above, as repetitions of the same word with a lengthening of the final vowel of the first are commonly used in Pāli in order to indicate the 
  <foreign>vīpsā</foreign>.</note> to herdsmen, cowherds, ministers, foresters, 
  <foreign>gumika</foreign>s, 
  <foreign>tūthika</foreign>s, 
  <foreign>neyika</foreign>s,
  <note>The first of the three words left untranslated corresponds to Sanskrit 
  <foreign>gaulmika</foreign>. As 
  <foreign>gulma</foreign> means both 'a thicket' and 'a picket of soldiers,' the derivative may denote either a kind of forest official or the leader of a 
  <foreign>gulma</foreign> of warriors. 
  <foreign>Tūthika</foreign> may be connected with Prākrit 
  <foreign>tūha</foreign> 'a Tīrtha,' and means 'overseers of fords' or 'of bathing places.' With 
  <foreign>neyika</foreign> compare 
  <foreign>naiyokāḥ</foreign> in Mr. Fleet and Elliot's grant, Indian Antiquary, vol. V, p. 62, line 28 of the text. Mr. Fleet changes it to 
  <foreign>niyuktāh</foreign>, which now seems a rather doubtful emendation. I suspect that 
  <foreign>naiyokāḥ</foreign> is a mistake for 
  <foreign>naiyikāḥ</foreign>, which would exactly correspond to 
  <foreign>neyika</foreign>, and that both words are corruptions of Sanskrit 
  <foreign>nāyaka</foreign>, commonly pronounced 
  <foreign>nāick</foreign>. If this is correct, the term denotes a military officer of the rank of a corporal or a sergeant.</note> and all others employed in our service, to roaming 
  <supplied reason="subaudible">spies</supplied> and warriors, 
  <note>
  <foreign>Saṃcarantaka</foreign> occurs also in Mr. Fleet's grant, loc. cit., line 29 of the text, and Mr. Fleet has translated it by 'travellers.' I believe that royal servants are meant, and that the word refers to the spies whom the Indian kings sent into the provinces to explore the behaviour of their officials,—see Manu, VII, 122.</note> and we grant here an immunity
