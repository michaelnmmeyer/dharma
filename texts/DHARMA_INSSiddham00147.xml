Gai seems practically certain that the Śarvavarman mentioned in the inscription is the Maukhari ruler and father of Avantivarman. I think this is doubtful.

Gai does not read a visarga at the end of l2. It is quite clear on his photograph, but if he did not read it, then the dots may perhaps be random. 
--><!-- 
Gai emends °varmma in l5 to °varmmaṇā. Probably right. 
--><!-- 
In l6, as Gai notes, there seems to be an unnecessary double daṇḍa after °āpyāyanāya. I should note that if this is a double daṇḍa, it is quite different from the one at the end of the inscription. This one is much smaller and has no hook or horizontal extension. Given the other uncertainties after this point, the daṇḍa is questionable. Could it be an inserted character? 
--><!-- 
Gai comments that śvita means "white" and here it may be understood as "clear". While I have no better interpretation, this seems too much of a stretch to me. The only alternative I can offer is to read paścina, taking the unclear and unnecessary double daṇḍa as a poorly executed pa, Gai's ta as na, and the whole meaning paścima - but this is again not very convincing. 
--><!-- 
Gai reads pā at the end of l6 and notes that the character is superfluous. He reads nothing after it, but there is definitely something there, much clearer than the purported pā which could, from Gai's photo, be just about anything. This last character looks like tha, or possibly "20". I cannot make sense of either, but the reading "pāniya-saṁgraha" in l7 (which Gai understands as "water-reservoir") also seems a bit doubtful; this bit at the end of l6 could be compounded to the not-quite-clear pāniya. 
--><!-- 
Gai emends kr̥ta at the end to kāritaḥ, which seems reasonable, but given the uncertainties, I'd rather leave it alone. 
--><!-- 
The final punctuation seems to be a pair of large verticals, the left one supplemented with a hook to the left at the top, and the right-hand one with a straight line to the right, at about half height.
