This inscription is digitally edited by Dániel Balogh from photographs of the original stone (taken at Gwalior Museum in January 2017). Some alternative opinions are cited from Bhandarkar's text in CII3rev (Bh) and, for the first fragment only, to those of Shastri_1913-14 (S) and Sircar SI. Version of January 2019.

L2. S and Bh read prāvr̥kkāle and emend. I agree with Sircar (SI) that the character is correctly ṭkā, though not a very nice one. I would expect k to have larger arms that curve down; more likely is a slightly angular ṭ with a scratch at the bottom left that looks like an arm on the left side.

L2. Bh follows S in emending maghe to mahe and dismisses Sten Konow's meghe pranr̥tte, suggested (apparently as a reading, not as an emendation) in #Shastri_1913-14:320n5. Bh also discusses this Indra festival briefly in #Bhandarkar_1981:263. The reading maghe is absolutely clear in the stone. Since śakramaha seems to be a very common name of the festival, I adopt the emendation. However, makhe (of which maghe a dialectal variation like āśvoja) is also plausible, compare pravr̥tteṣu makheṣu ca in Harivaṁśa 62.54 (the same passage where the Indra festival and Kr̥ṣṇa are discussed, and which also includes a long description of the joy and fertility of nature at this time, including sasasyāyāṁ ca sīmāyāṁ in 62.53 and phalavatsu tr̥ṇeṣu ca| ikṣumatsu ca deśeṣu in 62.54).
--><!--
L2. The vowel mark of kr̥ is conspicuously different from those of kr̥ in lines 1, 3 and 6: those are a regular curly diagonal attached to the stem of k, while this one curves the other way. This unusual form was probably engraved because the preceding sya was perceived to be in the way.

L5. V7a is unmetrical, not fitting either the pathyā or any vipulā pattern (would be a "ja-vipulā" if there is such a thing; it does, however, seem OK for an archaic anuṣṭubh). I believe this is not accidental, but a grammatical correction from an original siṁhavarmmasya that the poet would have had in mind.
--><!--
L5. Other editors read kṣitīśe. I think that would be redundant with pārtthive in the fourth quarter and the syntax is less messy this way. The character śa definitely has something at the top left, but it is not a full-fledged e mātrā (which should look like the left-hand component of śo in tridaśodāra, l. 7). Some, though not all, śa characters have a small headmark (see e.g. śakkrasya in l2), so here we may be dealing with a more pronounced headmark, or perhaps a different character was erroneously begun and then changed into śa.

<l n="d">-vid<unclear>y</unclear>ud-d<unclear>ī</unclear>pa-śikhā-cala<unclear>M</unclear></l><!--
L6. S and Bh read vidduddīpa, emending to vidyud. The intent was clearly vidyud, and the error is the engraver's, based on a smeared template. The ī of ddī extends far down on the left-hand side, almost as far as the subscript d of ddu. The template must have had dyu, with the subscript y extending far up, almost as far as the ī of ddī.
--><!--
L6. The final halanta M is unclear in the object as it is now exhibited, but seems to be inserted below (and barely to the right of) la. This is probably because the edge of the stone was near, not because it is a later insertion.

<l n="a"><lb

<l n="b">śaraṇyaṁ śaraṇaṅ gataḥ</l><!--
L7. Note the cursive form of lo where the curved stem of l bends down, right, then down again instead of attaching separate mātrās to the regular form. This seems to be generally a southern thing.
--><!--
L7. jñā is also unusually shaped. The ā mātrā (attached to the middle prong) curves back to touch the top right corner of j (this, without touching, also seems to be a southern characteristic), and the hook of ñ is a loop that crosses the stem to form the bottom right stroke, while the top left stroke is connected to the loop.
--><!--
L7. The śa of śaraṇa is also cursive: in other śa-s (including the one in śaraṇya) the middle bar is a separate horizontal stroke attached only to the right side of the body, whereas here it is a diagonal continuation from the bottom left.
--><!--
L7. ru is again cursive: the hook is changed into a loop that continues in the u mātrā (just like the bottom part of ñ earlier).
-->
<l n="c">tridaśodāra-phaladaṁ</l>
<l n="d">svargga-strī-cāru-pallavaM</l><!--
L7. The final m of pallavam is only very slightly smaller than regular characters and is not lowered, but has no headmark.

L7. Sircar (SI) notes that the comparison of Vāsudeva to a tree with the gods as its fruit may be a reference to the Viśvarūpa concept.

L8. S emends to brāhmaṇasāt kr̥tāḥ. Bh rejects this. Bh's emendation seems more reasonable than S's, since ga is clear. Tā is indiscernible in the object as it is presently exhibited (being covered with cement and whitewash), but clear in the rubbing.

Much of line 9 (especially in the first column, v13ab) is smeared with cement in the present state of the inscription. The bottoms of some letters may be altogether lost. In the rubbing, everything except the bottom of subscript characters is clear.
--><!--
L9. S and Bh take Satya to be the donor's name. I wonder; satya is surrounded by other laudatory adjectives and the name should come somewhere in the subsequent lost portion.

<l n="b">satputro jayamit<unclear>r</unclear>a<unclear>y</unclear>ā<!--
L9. Du is very unusual as the u mātrā curves up on the right, not on the left; moreover, it extends all the way to the headline. A very similar form occurs in Maitraka inscriptions (Bühler, G.: "Valabhï Grants: No. XV. - A Grant of ˜ïlåditya I., dated samvat 290" . Indian Antiquary  9.1880:  237-239 (2 Plates).); right-curving u that does not reach the headline also occurs in Valkha inss. (Ramesh-Tiwari No. 27).
--><!--
L9. Bhandarkar prints °tur bala, but the b is clearly doubled in the rubbing (in the actual stone, the end is all but obscured by plaster). S's text is correct.
--><!--
SI restores a visarga at the end and emends to jayamitrāyāḥ, but this would render the pāda unmetrical. Bh translates "son through Jayamitrā," implying that he accepts the instrumental, but in that case duhitur would not agree with jayamitrayā. Emending to duhitrā would take care of that problem, but leave satputro in c redundant. I therefore believe jayamitrayā was intended as a genitive, either through inattention or (in case jayamitrayāḥ was originally inscribed), as a conscious alteration of the word for the sake of the metre.
--></l><!--
I am assuming that fragment B is the direct continuation of fragment A. The appearance of the fragments neither proves nor disproves this. The edges do not seem to join, but they are exhibited in a sloppy manner, covered with cement. Neither the bottom of fragment A, nor the top of fragment B seems to bear any fragments of descending or ascending glyph parts, nor are any clearly lost on either side. Alternatively, any number of lines may have been lost between the two fragments; if the number of lost lines is even, then fragment B starts with a verse beginning; if the number is odd, fragment B starts at the middle of a stanza. To my knowledge no rubbing of fragment B has been published.

L14. Bhandarkar reads kruṣṇena°, emending to kr̥. The character is definitely kr̥, of the form that consists of a regular ka (the descender of which looks like an u mātrā), with a vowel mark curving from below the arms to the left and up. The same form occurs repeatedly in the first fragment (though the curving vowel mark is a bit larger and more ornate here, being at the beginning of a line). A different form is used in A2 in kr̥ṣṇasya, perhaps because the preceding sya left no room for the vowel mark to curl upward.

L14. At the end, most of a regular t is visible, but there are only indistinct vestiges of the subscript character.
