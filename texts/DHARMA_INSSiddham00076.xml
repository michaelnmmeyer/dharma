This inscription is digitally edited by Dániel Balogh from photographs of the original stone (taken in Jhalawar Museum in January 2017), with reference to Fleet's CII (F) and Sircar's SI (S). Conjectural restorations were originally suggested by Fleet unless otherwise noted. Version of January 2019.

Punctuation marks transcribed as double daṇḍas are double verticals with a hook at the top left of the first one. They seem to occur consistently at both half-verse and full-verse ends, though there doesn't appear to be one at the end of v1. (And the marks occur after every quarter of some longer verses at the end, v22 onward.) I supply identical punctuation at lost verse and half-verse ends.

L1. F (S following him) reads hasta-sarppa, showing only sa as unclear. He translates "the serpentine movement of the trunk" of Indra's elephant, which is a bit of a non sequitur. The subscript t and most of what F reads as sa are completely obliterated by a deep pit of the stone, P1010518. In the last character, subscript p is possible, but anything else is guesswork. I tentatively read dīrgghaḥ instead; the first lost character may have an i/ī mātrā, and the second one's main component resembles g, while the subscript component may be the left half of gh. Compare Harṣacarita 3, diṅnāga-hasta-dīrgho ... bāhur. Another possibility may be lamba (cf. lambi in v19).  S, but not F, restores a visarga after sarpa, which I think is necessary whatever the word; the half-verse would not have ended with an unfinished compound.

Compare the date in the Bihar Kotra inscription of Naravarman (IN00018:2-3), caturṣu varṣa-śateṣu catu[#ḥ]saptateṣu [but that reading needs to be checked]. Also compare the Chhoti Sadri inscr, IN00203:15-16, yāteṣu paṁcasu śateṣv atha vatsarāṇāṁ dve vi{!ṅ!}śatī-samadhikeṣu sa-saptakeṣu. Fleet is aware that his emended reading is unmetrical. He considers the alternative reading sausyaiṣṭhāśīta and emendation to saumye 'ṣṭāśīta, but rejects this because he feels saumye should be in locative plural agreeing with śateṣu. I think it's OK to see it as in apposition to dine in the second half, though not very nice. Fleet (1888:73-74n1) further discusses the date and notes caturṣu is unmetrical but must be correct. He also considers and rejects other possibilities, such as reading yāteṣu ca tsapu, with tsapu being a possible "pronunciation value" assigned to the numeral 4; and interpreting kr̥teṣu as bhūtasaṁkhyā meaning 4, preceded by an unintelligible string.

L19. In addition to the closeups, P1010493 and P1010494 also have good views of this section. For my reading ṣṭhāśīta, compare ṣvi a few characters later on in this line and ṣṭha in line 33 below: subscript v is more angular and its top is at the horizontal cenre; subscript ṭh is rounded and is attached at the top nearer the right-hand side. For my reading sye instead of syai, see the closeup photos. There are three strokes that may be vowel marks on this character on the basis of the rubbing. The one on the left, curving down, is definitely genuine. The one at the top, curving left, is very shallow and definitely not genuine. The one on the right seems to be slightly too large and crude, so I attribute it to damage.

L24-25. V17cd is problematic. Fleet reads ś where I read g and emend to ś - the crossbar is definitely missing; compare gyā for śyā in l27 (there read as g by Fleet too). He otherwise reads as I do but emends/restores to śāstraiḥ stute ca vinaye vyavahāra-hīne yo 'pakṣapāta-rahito nidadhau sva-cintāM, translating "and who, (by nature) not free from partiality (for this particular virtue), has (always) applied (his) thoughts to courteous behaviour, destitute of litigation, which is applauded by the sacred writings". The readings are unclear in many places, but are nonetheless almost certain. However, Fleet's interpretation is tenuous, especially his translation of vyavahāra as litigation, understood in the context as "squabble". While vyavahāra does mean litigation, it does not mean squabble, which would be comparable to using 'procedure' in English as a synonym of squabble. I also find the phrase apakṣapāta-rahita unlikely. My own interpretation is also tenuous, also depends on emendation, and may be too modern, but I still believe it is more likely to be correct than Fleet's. I would translate,"Who administered his duties without partiality toward [a man] praised in the śāstras as well as [one] without education and a profession." I also think a pun is intended with pakṣmapāta (pakṣa does not seem to be attested in the sense of eyelash), so that this "eye" never blinks.

L24. Though this does not affect the interpretation of the problematic part, Fleet's nidadhau is unlikely; the left-hand edge of dh is visible at the edge of the stone, so at least part of an au mātrā should also be visible if there had ever been one, so nidadhāti is more plausible. Of his sva-cintāM, only the halanta M is visible here, which is a tiny, simplified and deeply subscript character. Cintām or cittam are still possible, but in light of my interpretation above, I prefer kāryyam.

In the rubbing, the last character seems to have a rounded top and a crossbar, so ś is plausible. But in photos of the stone there does not seem to be a crossbar and there is definitely a headmark, so t is much more likely. The restoration of the lacuna is anyone's guess, e.g. jetā or hantā could be supplied, but Sircar's yantā is also fine.

As for kūṭṭala, compare kumudā° in l22 and kulo° in l28: this is ku, not kū. (Fleet's rubbing has a horizontal bar on the right, between the k's crossbar and the hook of u. But on the photos it is clear that this is a shallow indentation, not an engraved line.)

Willis_2009:179 (probably following Lorenzen 2006) restores pracudita and translates, "An abode of the Mothers whose thunderous cries impel the rain clouds, and whose treasure - the waters - bursts forth with the mighty wind produced by their lyre." pracudita is attested in the MBh in a transitive sense, but I still find it awkward. Before the extant di, there is a character component that is indeed probably an u mātrā of the plain vertical type, so we are looking for a verbal root ending in ud, excluding rud and a few other possibilities. I think praṇudita may be a better choice, though in MW this participle is only attested in the sense of "beaten, struck" - but the verb pra-ṇud carries the primary meanings "to push on , propel , set in motion." Continuing this: if Basham is correct in interpreting ghana as cymbal/gong, which sounds like a very good idea, then praṇudita as "struck" is perfectly in place. And, now that we have a primary meaning for this, I'm actually beginning to like Willis's interpretation as a _secondary_, śliṣṭa meaning.

L37. F reads pātāle at the end, but le is not possible, because the l has no tail extending over and to the left of the body (compare le in l6, sakalendu; l7, balena); instead, there is a loop over the body so the character must be lo (cf. e.g. avalokayantaḥ in l33). If the reading pātālo is correct, it is probably not a nominative but a compound, say pātālo[*gra] or something. Fleet puts 3 lost syllables in l37 after this, but this is not possible since the surface ends here cleanly; all the lost syllables must be at the beginning of the next line, where the base widens. At the beginning of l38, ra is clear. I can't come up with a plausible restoration. Perhaps pātālopanivāsi-***? pātālauka-***?

          <!-- 
L37. F emends to bhujaṅgopamaiḥ, which seems awkward to me. On the semantic level, what would resemble a serpent but not be one, yet could be perceived as protecting a well? For sculptures of serpents, they would not say they are comparable to serpents. And on a lower level, I don't really see where in the lacuna we might find room for a subject that is compared to snakes: both pātālo° and °ratibhir are likely to qualify the subject. Much more likely, I think, that the well is said to be protected by great snakes, which are of course sculpted.

F reads svādu, but the stone clearly has ssvā. This is interesting as a case of gemination before v; I don't think there are any others. It is definitely not a nominative ending before svādu.

F reads the last character in l38 as a tentative da; I'm almost certain it's pu, with the right-hand part gone except for part of the u mātrā. He puts four additional lost syllables in l38, which seems a bit too many; I prefer to distribute the akṣaras so that the number of lost syllables at the beginning of l39 is identical to that in l38 and l37.

L39. Fleet reads yāvacc (Sircar: yāvacca) at the end of l39. The reading is not impossible, but the character after their cc is almost certainly no or ṇa, there seems to be partial bh after that. One would also expect the sun to be mentioned in this verse. The character after va may be dbh (though it's a bit too angular in the upper body), and probably has an ā mātrā. Hence I prefer the conjectural reading+restoration °d bhānor bhavati.

L40. lma is unusual; the reading is clear, but it is formed of a (fairly) superscript l and a (just barely) subscript m rather than a mainline l and a subscript m. Probably to make sure there is room for the last line.

L40. F reads cendur, but there is no superscript r in gga. One could be supplied, but since g may be doubled before r (cf. °tyuggra in l37 above), it isn't required, and the syntax works with a compound. 
-->
          <!-- 
L40. F reads vyoma bhā at the end, restoring bhāsīkaroti (with indur as the subject, see previous comment). I find bhā unlikely; the traces of the character suggest sā, or at least s.

L41. Fleet notes that the ending °syediti is probably a conflation of °syeti with °sya syād iti. The reading is clear (P1010502). Fleet does not print the double daṇḍa here, but that is also clear.
