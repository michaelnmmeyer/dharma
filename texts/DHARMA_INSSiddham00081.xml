This is not explicitly stated anywhere I've read, but I assume that these double plates, each inscribed on one face only, use 1verso and 2 recto, with the blank side of each plate facing outward.

The maṅgala symbol (transcribed by Fleet as oṁ, without any note to say that it's a symbol) looks like a plain dash on the facsimile. It may have been meant to be to the left of the margin (rather than inline) and there is a small space (<1 character) between it and the character na, but the margin is not straight and lines begin progressively closer to the left edge of the plate. The beginning of the maṅgala symbol is about flush with the beginning of l3. 
--><!-- 
The punctuation sign is a double vertical, a regular pair of daṇḍas. 
--><!-- 
Fleet transliterates vda and corrects to bda, but the upper glyph looks like a fairly credible b.

Fleet says ti was first engraved and corrected to pi. This may be a simple error in his note; I don't see how he can be sure about the order of engraving and we should assume that an erroneous letter was corrected to a right one, not the other way round.

Fleet notes that the first ja in line 6 was omitted and inscribed later in the margin. This seems likely, but it is not certain; lines, as noted above, begin progressively earlier and earlier up to this point. The margin of lines 7 to 12 seems quite even, but perhaps l6 was furthest to the left without any marginal addition.

Fleet reads the toponym as ḍabhālā or ḍahālā and equates it to a toponym known to him as Ḍāhala, Ḍāhāla, Ḍahāla or Ḍahalā, "which seems to represent the modern Bundêlkhaṇḍ, and which was in later times a province of the Haihayas or Kalachuris of Tripura near Jabalpur" (Fleet_1888:114). Compare IN00090/9 where the name seems to be dabhālā with a dental d. 
--><!-- 
Fleet reads the last character in l8 as ḍi and notes that it needs correction, perhaps samyak, sampadi or sapadi. He rejects the correction samadhi because he finds no authority for the composition of sam and adhi with pā. It seems to me that the most likely reading is a slightly misshapen bhi, and sam-abhi-pālayati is attested in the Harivaṁśa, so even if this is not the actual reading, it's in my opinion the most straightforward emendation. Also compare IN00090/10 where the reading is samanupālayiṣṇor.

Fleet reads pālayipnor and emends to pālayiṣṇor; on the facsimile, the letter is damaged more than enough to be uncertain so I give the engraver the benefit of doubt. (However, grī is definitely grī in the original.)

I_0090/11 clearly has sthāpanābhiratena, so maybe recheck this reading, it could be bh too.

Fleet prints vijñāptyā, without correction. I see no clear ā mātrā so assume the inscription to be correct; this may be a typo in Fleet.

Fleet prints the r of svargga as supplied, but the facsimile is very unclear, so there may have been an original r there.

Fleet_1888:113n2 rejects Cunningham's identification of Piṣṭapura as Pithaora/Pataora 9 miles north of Uchaharā and says Piṣṭapura must be in the south (cf. Ilahabad pillar) and is also mentioned in a Cālukya inscription. The goddess must therefore be a local adoption of a southern goddess.

Fleet_1888:116n2 says peṭha is "a technical territorial term, represented in modern Marâṭhî by pêṭâ" and also occurring as veṇṭha in two Vijayanagar grants. The connection seems tenuous and the reading uncertain; what Fleet reads as pe does not in the least resemble (in the facsimile) the pā of opāṇi just two characters further on. I have no meaningful reading for it; it looks rather like śo to me. (Or possibly bo, with another tenuous connection to Kākanādaboṭa?) (But it does resemble pi in l16, so Fleet is probably right about the reading.)

Fleet transcribes no original punctuation after phalaṁ, but there is certainly something there, which may be a horizontal dash with some random scratches or (less likely from the facsimile) a subscript halanta M with a dash above (after a very conspicuous anusvāra).

Fleet reads the end of the line as ñca. The character is not too distinct on the facsimile, but it could be ntu just as probably as ñca (for which compare the end of the next line) and paripālanan tu is the reading of IN00090 at the identical locus.

Fleet reads nr̥dādyas. The top right of the character is a smudge and it could very well be nr̥dādyās, as in IN00090.

Fleet_1888:274-275n2 (on the Bodhgayā inscription of Mahānāman) says this figure should be revised to 27 on the basis of calculations by Sh B Dikshit which yield the result that Caitra śukla 13 (l2-3) was the 27th, not the 29th day of the month. So Fleet now thinks the faint mark below the vertical part belongs to the numeral, making it identical to the number of the day in the Mahānāman stela (%IN00119 l14). He adds that the same figure occurs in lines 19 and 21 of the Nepal inscription of Jiṣṇugupta (IA 9 p172) which Bhagwanlal Indraji interpeted as 8 - but Fleet apparently disagrees with that too.
