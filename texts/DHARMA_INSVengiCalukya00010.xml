<note>According to Rangacharya's editor, what Rangacharya saw as an 
<foreign>i</foreign> is only a crack in the plate, and the 
<foreign>e</foreign> is clearly present as the expected vowel marker. While the latter is correct, the crack seems to be there in addition to a fully formed

<note>The second character is definitely a cursive

<foreign>lo</foreign>, and moved to the right either accidentally or deliberately because of interference from the descenders (of 
<foreign>ty asti</foreign> in the previous line). I interpret the extra 
<foreign>n</foreign> at the end of the name in the present grant as the Sanskritised nominal ending

<note>Given the parallel in line 29 of the grant of Mādhavavarman I (see the commentary), the intent would have been 
<foreign>hastikośa-vīrakośau</foreign> in spite of the lack of agreement in number with 
<foreign>ājñaptir</foreign>. Incidentally, both instances of 
<foreign>ś</foreign> have conspicuous horns, which do not occur in any 
<foreign>śa</foreign> in these plates, all of which have plain, rounded tops. This may be irrelevant, but it also seems possible that 
<foreign>hastikośa-vīrakośau</foreign> was pre-written for the engraver, who in turn misinterpreted the final vowel mark as part of the consonant character, and applied the same to the earlier instance of the same consonant. What is perhaps even more likely is that the charter as a whole was adopted from the earlier Viṣṇukuṇḍin charter, and this section was copied without proper understanding. Rangacharya sees an indistinct 
<foreign>vyā</foreign> at the end of line 22, 
<q>beneath the punctuation mark and not separate.</q> I see no punctuation mark, nor does Rangacharya print one in his edition. In the scanned rubbing, 
<foreign>yo</foreign> seems to be clear, but there is a very faint loop below it that may perhaps be a subscript 
<foreign>y</foreign>. Since Sircar also reads a supposedly clear 
<foreign>byā</foreign> here, I assume that this is indeed a superscript 
<foreign>y</foreign>, but since there are very conspicuous strokes that do not belong to either 
<foreign>vyā</foreign> or 
<foreign>byā</foreign>, I believe the scribe had corrected 
<foreign>yo</foreign> to 
<foreign>vyā</foreign>, or possibly to 
<foreign>byā</foreign>.</note>

<note>It seems that some previous scholars see

  <citedRange>138</citedRange>

<note>It seems likely that

  <citedRange>74</citedRange>

<div type="commentary">
<p>As pointed out in the apparatus, I agree with Sankaranarayanan in reading the donated village’s name. The second 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign> of the name is definitely a cursive 
<foreign>lo</foreign>. When 
<foreign>lī</foreign> is written in a similar form, the tail of the spiral-shaped vowel mark is on the left side, while 
<foreign>le</foreign>, when written cursively, does not have a tail at all. Compare the identical-looking 
<foreign>lo</foreign> in 
<foreign>lokāśrayā°</foreign>, line 9 of the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00009.xml">Peddavegi plates</ref>, and the different (though unclear) 
<foreign>lī</foreign> in 
<foreign>vimalīkr̥ta</foreign>, line 17 of the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00008.xml">Niḍupaṟu Grant</ref>. The ARIE report reconstructs the name of the village as Pulebūra, while Rangacharya reconstructs it as Pulibūru, and tentatively identifies it as modern Polamūru in the erstwhile Bhīmavaram taluk. The reading of the name of the village is confirmed by the continuity with the Viṣṇukuṇḍin grant concerning the same village (Polamuru plates of Mādhavavarman I, ed. 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:SubbaRao1931-1932_01" />
</bibl> and 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Sankaranarayanan1977_01" />
  <citedRange>178-181</citedRange>
</bibl>), as pointed out by Arlo Griffiths and Vincent Tournier (both in email, 23 April 2020). The findspot of that grant is said to be the village Polamūru in Ramachandrapuram taluk, East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. The only Polamuru I can find on a map is at 16.891415 81.957187 in the Anaparthy taluk of East Godavari district (and another in West Godavari district, somewhat closer to the town of Bhīmavaram); I am not certain which was meant by Rangacharya, but since the donee of the present charter is definitely the son of the donee of the Viṣṇukuṇḍin charter, the two sets of plates must come from the same place. The spelling of the name in the parallel text is 
<foreign>Pulo
<unclear>ṁbū</unclear>ru</foreign>. Further, as indicated by Jens Thomas (also in email, 23 April 2020), the name in all probability contains the Telugu word 
<foreign>pulombu</foreign>, meaning a field, also confirming that the 
<foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is to be read with the syllable 
<foreign>lo</foreign>, and giving us a name that means “field-village.” For 
<foreign>anusvāra</foreign>s shifted to the right without a discernible cause, compare the 
<ref n="tfb-badamicalukya-epigraphy" target="CalE08-Modlimb-Pulakesin2.xml">Modlimb plates of Pulakeśin II</ref> (l7, 
<foreign>vaṁśe</foreign>; l15, 
<foreign>ṣaṣṭiṁ</foreign>). Somasekara Sarma 
<bibl rend="omitname">
  <ptr target="bib:SomasekaraSarma1930_01" />
  <citedRange>183</citedRange>
</bibl> argues in a similar vein that the correct form of the name is 
<foreign>Puloṁbūru</foreign> (probably without intending to claim that a final 
<foreign>u</foreign> is present here).</p>
<p>In the ARIE report, the date is recorded as 
<q>[1]5th year (in numerical symbols), [śu.] di. 6, [Sunday]</q>. Somasekara Sarma 
<bibl rend="omitname">
  <ptr target="bib:SomasekaraSarma1930_01" />
  <citedRange>183</citedRange>
</bibl> proposes to read 
<foreign>5 gi 8 di 7</foreign> (with some additional characters that may be incorrectly typeset punctuation marks, and a tentative emendation of 
<foreign>gi</foreign> to 
<foreign>grī</foreign>) It seems that the fairly clear double 
<foreign>daṇḍa</foreign> was tentatively read as 10 for the ARIE report. For the next character, all editors agree on 5 (10 also seems possible to me, and it resembles neither the 5 nor the 10 in line 20 of the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00002.xml">Cīpurupalle plates</ref>). This may be followed by another character or even two, squeezed underneath the descender of the first 
<foreign>yasya</foreign> in the previous line, and apparently interpreted by Sircar and Sankaranarayanan as a single 
<foreign>daṇḍa</foreign>. If this is correct, then the symbol is apparently not straight but curved like the right half of an O. For the next character, 
<foreign>gi</foreign> (for 
<foreign>giṁha</foreign>) is very plausible, but not clear. Next, the ARIE reader sees 6, while all others who venture a reading see 8, which does seem slightly more likely, but is far from clear to me in the scan. At the end, 
<foreign>di</foreign> is again very plausible, and was probably read as 
<foreign>vi</foreign> by the ARIE decipherer, possibly even as 
<foreign>ravi</foreign> in conjunction with what may be a 
<foreign>daṇḍa</foreign> before it. The final character is beyond blurred in the scan and I have no opinion on it.</p>
<p>The seal is lost, though the ring is extant. Page 1 is clearly paginated on the verso, with the number 1 in the upper part of the left margin, and with lines 2 and 3 on that page indented to leave some clear space around the number. There may be a numeral 2 in a similar position on the verso of page 2, but the text lines do not make way for this one, and it is a simpler glyph consisting of two straight lines, whereas the 1 is a strongly curved line. I assume it is also pagination (Rangacharya p254: 
<q>The plates are numbered, though the figure on the first plate alone is clear.</q>), but it may have been added after inscribing the text. I see no page number on the recto of page 3 (unless three dots in a rough triangle, in the left margin between the third and fourth line on that page qualify as one), and there is no facsimile of the verso.</p>

<lb />sa-gītāḥ in line 22. The ARIE report, Rangacharya and his editor all agree on understanding these two terms as the designations of two offices, and make no issue of the singular 
<foreign>ājñapti</foreign> being in apposition to them. Rangacharya notes, 
<cit>
  <quote>The word 
  <foreign>kōśa</foreign> has different meanings in Tamil classical literature. Dr. Krishnaswami Aiyangar identifies the Kōśar who invaded the Pāṇḍyan kingdom with the vanguards of the Vamba or later (or illegitimate) Mauryas and connects them with the Kōśakāras of Assam referred to in the 
  <title>Rāmāyaṇa</title>. The Kōśars seem to have been not only a particular tribe but (1) soldiers in general; (2) followers or relatives of kings corresponding to the Sanskrit Rājanyas; (3) officers of justice in village courts, etc. In the present record the word seems to mean, as the Govt. Epigraphist points out, an officer.</quote>

</cit> Sircar (IEG s.vv. hastikośa, vīrakośa) endorses this interpretation. Given the uncertainty of the reading, possibly a dual genitive was intended instead, but I do not know of a parallel where the ājñapti is said to be someone's (rather than someone). The intent may also have been 
<foreign>hastikośo vīrakośaḥ</foreign>, with one of these (most likely the latter) being a name, and only the other (the former) is an office. Less specifically, this interpretation was also raised by Estienne-Monod (see the note to her translation of this phrase).</p>
