              <summary>
                <p>Original punctuation marks are plain verticals, used singly and doubly. The opening symbol is either a floret with eight petals, or one with four petals and spikes in between each pair of petals.</p>
                <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is usually to the right of the character to which it belongs, at or below or above headline level. Occasionally, mainly (or only) when in combination with dependent I, it may be pushed over above the next character (e.g. l8, viṁśati), and a line break may intervene in such cases (l8-9, jayasiṁhas), though at most line breaks, the anusvāra is either at the end of the former line or omitted. The marker for dependent o in the cursive form may extend down to the footline (e.g. l1, go). It is clearly sistinguishable from au, which is prominently asymmetrical (e.g. l2, kau), but occasionally o is written where au is expected. Dependent o consisting of two strokes also occurs when the left-hand stroke is attached to the body (e.g. l7, jo) as well as when attached to the head (e.g. l8, no). Upadhmānīya (l8) looks like ṟa with the top open. The conjunct ṣṣ (l9, l11) looks like ṣv. Initial A is sometimes indistinguishable from la (or the latter is inscribed erroneously for the former); see e.g. l38 for a distinct A and @@@ for one that looks like la. Independent I (e.g. l22) is drawn cursively with a single line and has a looped bottom part. Initial Ī (e.g. l64) resembles ka. Dependent e, superscript r and the tail of final consonants look much the same (see l28 dor-ddaṇḍerita for the former two side by side).

                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question. See EG 11.2. --></p>
              </summary>
              <handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00070_hand1">A very neat and precise hand with a slight tendency for characters to lean to the right. In many cases, the tops of subscript y and dependent u are bent to the right (and often also down), so that the characters affected seem to have an ā attached in the case of subscript y, and seem to have long ū instead of u. In many instances, but not always, these hooks have been corrected by hammering them out. That the work of this primary hand was subjected to careful proofreading is indicated by a number of other features, most notably the way descenders have been subsequently enlarged in an ornamental way when a space was left blank in the next line because of a descender.</handNote>
              <handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00070_hand2">Possibly the same person doing less careful work. I cannot point to any distinctive character details, but the work of this hand is definitely less neat. The details of the grant (starting in lin 65, to the end of line 67) was written in this hand, almost certainly at a later time than the preceding and following text, as indicated by the blank space at the end of line 67.</handNote>

              <note>The vowel marker in <foreign>gryā</foreign> is attached to the headmark of the principal consonant, not to the end of the subscript <foreign>y</foreign>.

It also seems that the shape of the subscript <foreign>y</foreign> was revised, from an original regular form to one that has a downward cusp. I cannot figure out what went on here; either or both of the <foreign>ā</foreign> and the <foreign>y</foreign> may have been added subsequently. The <foreign>ā</foreign> of <foreign>ṇā</foreign> may also be a subsequent addition; it is a full-length vertical stroke to the right of the likewise full-lenfth right wing of <foreign>ṇ</foreign>, rather than an upward turn of that right wing (as in line 37), but <foreign>ṇā</foreign> is similarly formed (though with a shorter vertical stroke for <foreign>ā</foreign>) in lines 1 and 2.

A deleted <foreign>ta</foreign> is clearly clearly recognisable, its bottom overlapping the top of the retained <foreign>ta</foreign>. The only reason for the deleted <foreign>ta</foreign> that I can conceive of is that the scribe first continued the line level with the top of <foreign>ji</foreign>, but then realised this mistake and re-engraved <foreign>ta</foreign> level with the rest of the line. As in line 43 above, the scribal quirks offer no help in understanding the word. The simplest solution is probably to emend to <foreign>īḍitan</foreign>, and the composer may have had something else in mind (<foreign>īrṣitan</foreign>? <foreign>īhitan</foreign>? <foreign>īpsitan</foreign>?).

Either it presupposes knowledge of a Purāṇic story of which I am not aware, or it has a surreptitious scribal error.

Out of context, the stanza would straightforwardly mean that Brahmā created the world for the expansion of his <supplied reason="explanation">Brahmā’s</supplied> glory, and that Viṣṇu went off to perform austerities, first depositing his Śrī and his own self <supplied reason="explanation">whatever that may mean</supplied> in his <supplied reason="explanation">Brahmā’s</supplied> breast. But this does not seem to be a coherent story, nor one known from elsewhere, and it is moreover completely irrelevant to the context, which should be the laudation of Amma II. I therefore provisionally interpret the stanza to be an <foreign>atiśayokti</foreign> claiming first, that the sole reason why Brahmā created the world was to have a place that could be filled up with Amma’s glory; and second, unrelatedly to the first, that Viṣṇu deposited his own Śrī on Amma’s bosom and even his original self in Amma’s heart, and then went off to become an ascetic, i.e. retired from worldly affairs.</note></p>

As we know from other grants that Amma was crowned at the age of 12, the statement that he was a child when he was dethroned should also mean that his first reign lasted at most for a few years. However, the fact that Amma is praised in the text, and partly with the same stanzas that are also used in Amma’s own grants, makes it quite certain that Amma II did reign for some time, and issue grants of his own, before Bādapa took over.</note></p>

There are several Nāgaśarmans mentioned in Eastern Cālukya grants, though no other Ahiśarman that I know of.

        <p>The findspot of these plates is Arumbāka (written so in the ARIE discussion, Ārambāka in the ARIE appendix), the same village from where the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00030.xml">Ārumbāka grant of Bādapa</ref> was recovered some 18 years earlier.</p>
        <p>The text up to stanza 8 is almost to the letter identical to the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00038.xml">Maliyapūṇḍi grant</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00047.xml">Vemalūrpāḍu plates</ref> of Amma II.</p>
        <p n="5" rend="stanza">As of September 2021, I have come across three specimens of this verse, as stanza 6 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00038.xml">Maliyapūṇḍi grant of Amma II</ref> (hereafter: M), stanza 5 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00047.xml">Vemalūrpāḍu plates of Amma II</ref> (hereafter: V), and stanza 5 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00070.xml">Īnteṟu grant of Bādapa</ref> (hereafter: Ī). The variation between these specimens is minor and none are fully intelligble. My reconstruction of the stanza as intended by the composer runs as follows: <foreign>anye mānya-mahībhr̥to ’pi bahavo duṣṭa-pravr̥ttād dhatāḥ| deśopadrava-kāriṇaḥ prakaṭitāḥ kālālayaṁ prāpitāḥ| dor-ddaṇḍerita-maṇḍalāgra-latayā yasyogra-sāṁgrāmikā| vājñā tat-para-bhū-nr̥paiś ca śirasā māleva sandhāryyate||</foreign>
<list>
            <item><foreign>pravr̥ttāddhatāḥ</foreign> is the received reading identical in all three, including the lack of sandhi (complemented with a punctuation mark in V). Butterworth and Venugopaul Chetty, the first editors of M (hereafter: BVC), accept this reading, while
Hultzsch (hereafter: H) emends it to <foreign>pravr̥ttoddhatāḥ</foreign>.</item>
            <item><foreign>kālālayaṁ</foreign> appears without a recognisable <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> in M and V, and the text is intelligible that way. However, the <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is clearly present in Ī, yielding a better text, so I assume that it has been lost or accidentally omitted in the other two records.</item>
            <item><foreign>sāṁgrāmikā vājñā</foreign> is not attested as such; the variants are M <foreign>saṁgrāmakāvājñā</foreign>; V <foreign>saṁgrāmakānājñā</foreign>; Ī <foreign>sāṁgrāmikanājñā</foreign>. BVC emend to <foreign>saṁgrāmakasyājñā</foreign> in their edition of M, which H tentatively endorses in his re-edition of M and his edition of V. I find this too heavy-handed and believe that the composer may have used <foreign>vā</foreign> in the sense of <foreign>eva</foreign> (or, essentially, as a hiatus filler). However, the original intent may also have been the better attested <foreign>sāṁgrāmikā nājñā</foreign>, in which case <foreign>n</foreign> must be a hiatus filler (cf. BHSG §4.65).</item>
            <item><foreign>para-bhū-nr̥paiś</foreign> is also not attested; M and V read <foreign>parabhr̥nr̥paiś</foreign>, while Ī has <foreign>parabhr̥nnr̥paiś</foreign>. BVC and H both emend <foreign>bhr̥</foreign> to <foreign>bhū</foreign>. While <foreign>para-bhr̥t</foreign> is a legitimate word for which Ī appears to supply confirmation, I cannot make sense of it in the context. Conversely, engraving <foreign>bhr̥</foreign> instead of <foreign>bhū</foreign> is a very straightforward scribal mistake, and <foreign>bhr̥n</foreign> may be the result of the scribe’s attempt to make sense of the unintelligible <foreign>bhr̥</foreign>.</item>
            <item>For <foreign>śirasā</foreign>, M and V read <foreign>śiraso</foreign>. The text is intelligible that way (and H does not emend it in his editions), but I agree with BVC that <foreign>śirasā</foreign> (to be construed with <foreign>sandhāryyate</foreign>) is more elegant, and this reading is confirmed by Ī.</item>
          </list>
I thus prefer to interpret the stanza as indicated in my translation. However, depending on the choice of readings, a number of slightly different alternative interpretations may be possible. If <foreign>pravr̥ttoddhatāḥ</foreign> is preferred in <foreign>pāda</foreign> a, then the other kings are “formidable and obdurate in their depravity, blatantly wrecking the country.” Reading <foreign>saṁgrāma-kāv</foreign> in <foreign>pāda</foreign> c, the text might mean that “his command (given) on the field of vicious battle is borne on the head,” but this relies on the rather laborious use of <foreign>ku</foreign> in the sense of <foreign>bhūmi</foreign>. The phrase <foreign>tat-para-bhū-nr̥paiś</foreign> could be construed as <foreign>tatpara-bhū-nr̥paiś</foreign>, “kings of the land (i.e. subordinates) intent (on obedience),” but the contrast with kings of other lands is poetically more effective.</p>
        <p n="16" rend="stanza">This stanza is in an <foreign>ardhasama</foreign> metre to which I have not been able to put a name. Although its metre is marred by some scribal errors, its prosodic pattern is beyond reasonable doubt ⏑⏑–⏑⏑–⏑–⏑–⏓ (sa-sa-ja-ga-ga, 11 syllables) in the odd lines and ⏑⏑⏑⏑–⏑⏑–⏑–⏑⏓ (na-ja-ja-ra, 12 syllables) in the even lines. The odd lines are thus identical to the odd lines of the <foreign>mālabhāriṇī</foreign> metre, while the even lines are almost identical to the even lines of the <foreign>viyoginī</foreign> metre except that the long third syllable of the <foreign>viyoginī</foreign> is here replaced by two short syllables. The template of the even lines occurs in some metrical reference works as a <foreign>samacatuṣpadī</foreign> form by the names <foreign>tati</foreign>, <foreign>mālatī</foreign>, <foreign>yamunā</foreign> and <foreign>varatanu</foreign>, but the template of the odd lines, as far as I can ascertain, only occurs in the odd lines of <foreign>mālabhāriṇī</foreign>.</p>
        <p n="19" rend="stanza">The reading, grammar and meaning of this stanza are perfectly clear, but the metre is beyond strange: rather than four quarters of 8 syllables each, the word ends suggest quarters in the pattern of 9-7-9-7 syllables.</p>
