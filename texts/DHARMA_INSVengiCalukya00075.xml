              <p>Halantas. Final N (e.g. l6, l7) is a simplified na without a headmark. Final T (l39) is a slightly reduced ta with an elongated vertical stem without a headmark. Final M (l44, l45) is a stylised ma (lacking the right limb), with an extension that begins horizontally and then turns sharply upward.</p>
              <p>Original punctuation marks are short, straight verticals with small serifs. The closing gomūtra symbol is a series of 4 diminishing bars (in addition to the first two, which I interpret as a separate double daṇḍa). The fourth bar is only a dot, and this is followed by a final dot from which a flourish extends right and then up, vaguely resembling a tick mark.</p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally at the top right of the character to which it belongs, but sometimes (e.g. l1 sagotrāṇāṁ) above the next character. There is a probable instance of rare jh in line 35. This subscript component begins with a shape resembling ka or ña. Attached to this, on its right-hand side, slightly below the crossbar, there is a wavy horizontal line which then turns upward at a soft right angle. In addition, there is a circle like an 
              <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>, placed to the right of this additional stroke, on a level with its horizontal component. The circle may be irrelevant, but it does not look like random damage. Dependent o is always written with two separate strokes. </p>

<note>The text is somewhat problematic here; see the apparatus to line 24. I believe the beginning of 
<foreign>pāda</foreign> b may be connected to the topic of the first quarter, as in my tentative translation. Fear of ageing and death motivates to good conduct through a concern for the afterlife. The word 
<foreign>māraṇa</foreign> may have been intended as it is (“killing,” i.e. capital punishment), but coupled with 
<foreign>jarā</foreign> (lengthened for the sake of the metre into 
<foreign>jārā</foreign>), it is much more likely that the word intended is 
<foreign>maraṇa</foreign>, “dying,” also lengthened for the sake of the metre. If this phrase is not connected to the first quarter, then the sense is that those who are afraid of old age and death have adopted good conduct. This, however, is rather bland and says nothing about the merit of the king.</note> the earth has become free from calamities

<note>The text is again problematic; see the apparatus to line 24. Failing to find a better solution, I make a minor emendation (
<foreign>āsu</foreign> to 
<foreign>āśu</foreign>) and interpret 
<foreign>asu</foreign> to mean “grief,” though this is attested only in lexicons and neuter in gender. Nonetheless, 
<foreign>trividhāsu</foreign> was probably intended to mean the same as 
<foreign>duḥkha-traya</foreign>, the three kinds of grief, usually enumerated as 
<foreign>ādhyātmika</foreign>, 
<foreign>ādhibhautika</foreign> and 
<foreign>ādhidaivika</foreign>: grief originating from within one’s person, from living beings (and/or the physical world), and from the gods (fate).</note> the rain follows the desire of the populace; diseases have ceased to exist; and the Brahmins perform the sacrifices well 
<seg cert="low">even if they are hard to perform</seg>.
<note> The text is again awkward; see the apparatus to line 26. I believe the composer used 
<foreign>yatho</foreign> (
<foreign>yathā+u</foreign>; or perhaps equivalent to 
<foreign>atho</foreign> with an epenthetic 
<foreign>y</foreign>?) in the sense of “even” or perhaps “all the more so if,” and 
<foreign>ku-kriya</foreign> in the sense of 
<foreign>duṣkara</foreign>. This interpretation is, however, problematic; 
<foreign>duṣkarāḥ</foreign> would have fit the metre perfectly if this was what the composer had wished to express. Emending 
<foreign>yatho</foreign> to 
<foreign>yato</foreign> would result in an interpretable, though still very awkward sentence meaning “diseases have ceased to exist 
<supplied reason="subaudible">along with</supplied> bad deeds, because the Brahmins perform the sacrifices well.</note>
