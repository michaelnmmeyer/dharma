V3. Fleet 1888 translates "He who ... through the action simply of (his good) intentions shone gloriously, not associating with other kings ... just as an offering of flowers (is beautiful when it is not laid down in the dust); he in whom ... the title of "universal sovereign" shines more...". But yo in 3a points to śabdaḥ, and only yattra refers to Yaśodharman. (In the same way, ye in the next verse goes with deśāṁs, and only yo points to YD.) Revised by Fleet 1889 (on suggestion of Kielhorn); SI agrees with the revision.)

        <!-- 
V4. Fleet translates "spurning (the confinement of) the boundaries of his own house, enjoys those countries". #Mirashi_1980b:412, however, notes that according to Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.3.66 the root bhuj always takes ātmanepada except when it means "protect", i.e. it means protect here, because it is parasmaipada. He therefore suggests that YD is not claiming to hold more lands than the Guptas and Huns, but to protect his own lands "with as little concern as he does the courtyard of his own house" in spite of the Guptas' and Huns' attempts to conquer them. I'm not sure the grammatical point is strong evidence (after all, compare the next verse) and vīryāvaskanna-rājñaḥ is problematic with that interpretation, yet there may be something to it. Regardless of this, the interpretation that he does this with the same contempt he has for his own courtyard may be better than Fleet's.

L5. This is the only upadhmānīya in the inscription, compare madaiḥ pādayor just a few words onward. It looks like two separate loops attached to the top of p.

          <!-- 
L5. Fleet_1888:145 calls attention to the use of inline rather than superscript r, combined with a single y, in sāmantair yasya as well as in vīrya in l4 above. Though there is no apparent reason in l4, I must note that here the use of this glyph must have been for the sake of calligraphy, which is very careful throughout the inscription. Here, ntai extends below the line so there would have been no room to extend the lower ya of a ryya to the left, while using this rya character, there is room both for ntai and for the extended loop of the following sya.

L6. Fleet prints prāpitāṁ, but his rubbing shows prāpitaṁ, which is what is required by the syntax. Pathak 1908:97 suggests emending to prāpitaṁ, but ā is probably just a typo in Fleet's text. SI prints prāpitaṁ.

L6. Fleet's translation of v6 takes the first two lines to refer to YD; the suggestion that they refer to Mihirakula are from Kielhorn in Fleet 1889. 
-->
          <!-- 
L6. Note rd not doubled in girir durgga. 
-->
          <!-- 
L6. The halanta m is indistinct in both the rubbing and the photo, but seems to be a small subscript character with an elongated stem, in shape resembling la. However, the M in l8 is just a small simplified subscript character with a line above it, so there may be a scratch on the stone here.

L7. The first character, which Fleet reads tentatively as gā, is completely weathered away. Neither Fleet's rubbing nor my photos show any recognisable vestige, though 1010031 shows this area sharply. Fleet translates gām eva with "as if to measure out the earth", Bakker in Portfolio translates "as if to measure the earth from above." However, we should probably have something meaning "to measure the sky" here. Compare unmāpayad iva vyoma in v23 l18 of Risthal. (Fleet takes ūrdhvaṁ with the stars, but the caesura to some extent also implies it should go with the first part of the line.) Gām ūrdhvam could very well mean "the sky" and I can't exclude that restoration, but I feel eva ivārthe would be very bad form, and therefore propose to restore dhāmevonmātum.

          <!-- 
L8. caritam agha-haraṁ may be a parallel for vinaya-muṣi yuge as both are better interpreted not as actively "removing" but simply "lacking". Semantically they are also a nice counterpoint to one another.

L8. Kielhorn 1891:188 suggests changing Fleet's translation "customs of mankind continue current, unimpeded (in any way) by him" to "controlled by him, the conduct of mankind does not swerve (from the right course)". SI agrees, so do I.

L9. The vi of govindena has a mātrā extending down on the left-hand side of the va and curling back up - a sort of signature flourish, since all other i mātrās in the inscription seem to be only above the top.

L9. The closing punctuation is also a double vertical like previous verse-end markers, but this one also has a distinct hook at the top left, which was not present at the verse ends.
