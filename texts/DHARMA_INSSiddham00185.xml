L.ii. Shastri & Kawadkar (SK) print an original daṇḍa at the end of the line, but no visarga. I see no recognisable punctuation mark in the rubbing, but there may be both a faint visarga and a faint dash. However, given the excellent condition of the whole set of plates, I think it's better to assume that there is neither visarga nor daṇḍa in the original.

SK treat dr̥ṣṭaṁ as part of l1, but it is definitely a separate block, being a little lower than l1 and starting right at the edge of the plate, before the margin of the subsequent lines. L1 itself starts with an indent of about 1 character. Also, though this may be an artefact of the rubbing, it seems pretty certain that dr̥ṣṭaṁ was engraved after the text of l2 was already in place. The subscript ṭ intersects the vowel of śrī in l2, and - in the inked rubbing - the white line of the ṭ has a thin black edge at this intersection. This edge is too thin to assume that the ī mātrā was inscribed after the ṭ was in place, and its line was interrupted at the intersection point then continued on; but it seems perfectly plausible that the edge is a kerf mark (or whatever the proper term is) raised by the engraver's tool when inscribing the ṭ after the ī.

L3. SK read licchavī and specifically note this as an instance of mixing up i and ī marks. In the rubbing the mark could very well pass for short i; actually, the one in dauhitro looks more like ī. So why not give the engraver the benefit of doubt?

From the beginning of 2recto, the text seems to be in a different hand. Maybe we should mark up the hand change in proper XML. The characters in this second hand are neater and slightly larger. The most conspicuous mark of the hand change is the form of the subscript y, which is practically a circle here, very much like (or completely identical to?) the form used in the Masod plates, IN00184. The first hand used the regular form of subscript y. Also, the hand2 uses a distinctly southern ja, without a box head, but with a wavy top line and a wavy left vertical. (The same outline appears in ṅ in l8.) ṇa is probably also different: in hand1 (only 1 specimen on 1verso, not very clear and in ligature) it seems to be a regular vākāṭaka ṇ with a boxhead, very similar to no; in hand2 ṇa has no boxhead, only a pair of wings at the top. In hand2, ī seems always to be marked with a double circle (śrī at the end of l6 may in fact be śri, but part is rubbed off and śrī is not impossible); in hand1, neither i nor ī are closed into a circle (both being open on the left), but i is just a curve, while ī is a spiral. In hand2, ā mātrās are attached to the top of most consonants; in hand1 this happens occasionally but the general rule seems that ā mātrās are on the right-hand side.

L13. SK print °ārtthaṁ as clear. This is the very edge of the plate, and SK's rubbing seems to end a hair's breadth before the edge, but there is almost certainly no anusvāra, and only a faint trace of what may be a superscript r.

L14. SK print kaśyapa (also writing about Kaśyapa gotra in their commentary, p141). kā is clear in the rubbing.

L14. SK print vājasaneya (also in their commentary). I'm fairly certain the plate actually has vājasaneyi, though the i mātrā is faint and squashed on acount of smā hanging down from above. 
--><!-- 
L14. Where I read an unclear daṇḍa, SK read (and delete) a visarga. It is not damaged at all, consisting very clearly of two very short horizontal dashes. I think a visarga is unlikely at this point (especially since there have so far been no clear visargas in the inscription even where expected), and the mark is probably punctuation, perhaps in a function sort of like a colon, to imply that the gotra etc specifications apply to all the following names. 
--><!-- 
L14. SK read bhaṭṭyāryya, emending to bhaṭṭāryya (which is the name they mention in their commentary). I think bhaṭṭy-āryya would be perfectly acceptable, but the plate actually has bhaṭyāryyā (the first ā mātrā is all but invisible, but I assume it is there since it's expected and SK read it; the second is also unclear and SK do not read it, but it is more discernible than the first and matches the āryyās in the following line). Nonetheless, the intent was probably bhaṭṭy-āryya.

L15. SK read govyāryya-śaṅkarāryya; the unexpected ā endings of both are clear in the rubbing. 
--><!-- 
L15. SK read dharāryyāyaḥ, deleting the visarga. I think once again that this is a punctuation mark (though it is not identical to the one in l14, the dashes being even shorter and closer together), marking the end of the list. 
--><!-- 
L15. SK emend atisr̥ṣṭā to atisr̥ṣṭa, which doesn't seem to make sense. I believe the intent must have been atisr̥ṣṭāḥ, which is consistent with the lack of visargas throughout the text so far, and agrees grammatically with yūyam - even though addressing people as chattel does seem sort of surprising.

L16. At 3 recto the hand changes back to the first one or at any rate one very much like the first one.

            </choice>-grāma-maryyādā śarkkara<!-- 
L16. SK read °anumatāścāturatra, emending to °anumatācaturatra, at least in their edition. The text cited in their commentary (p141) is °anumatāś cātur atra, so they seem to understand "atra"; I have no idea how they construe catur or cātur - is this supposed to mean four boundaries? While "atra grāma-maryyādā" makes some sense, the plate definitely doesn't have tra. The character appars to be tta or possibly nta (though n has, I believe, been always looped so far, and tta in l18 doesn't look identical: this one uses the symmetrical (older?) subscript t, while elsewhere it's an angled projection from the descender). So most probably this is just a weird error for cāturvvaidya, and perhaps the engraver didn't even know or care what character he was producing. Then the text gets seriously jumbled: the expected continuation, parihārān, comes in l18 below (and it is preceded, rather than followed by tad yathā). Perhaps the plates are copies of an earlier set, which had the boundaries added to the bottom of one plate that originally ended at maryyādā? 
--><!-- 
L16. In addition to the hand change, we now begin to get jumbled-up text like in the Masod plate.

L25. Character space in this line is a bit irregular; many characters are not as close together as everywhere else. The largest space (still less than a character's width) is after vā; there is also noticeable space before and after rā at the end and a few smaller spaces here and there. This may indicate that the plate is a copy/forgery, but the next plate is not, and the copier needed to stretch his text at the end of plate 3 to meet the beginning of plate 4. (Line 25 contains only 19 akṣaras as opposed to 23 in l24 and a similar quantity in most other lines.) See also note to l26.

L26. SK read vveditasya, emending to rvveditasya. The superscript r is in fact quite clear, and the e mātrā is attached to its top, not to the boxhead. However, SK do not mention the fact that the reading does not splice well with the end of plate 3. I emend to āveditasya to get a seamless transition, but my suspicion is that plate 3 is a replacement or a forgery. veditasya and āveditasya both occur in this context in cognate plates, though I think āveditasya is much more common. But the original plate3 must have ended with brāhmaṇai, not with brāhmaṇairā.

L30. The punctuation mark at the halfverse point is very similar to the one in l24 (though SK say it is different) and may indeed have been meant as a short vertical above a short horizontal, rather than just a pair of dots.
