              <summary>
                <p>Halantas. Final T (line 10) seems to be a ta without a headmark, perhaps slightly reduced in size; it may have a tail; the specimen in line 14 (employed to avoid the ligature tkr̥) definitely has one, looking much like a repha, while that in line 64 appears to be full-sized and may or may not have a tail. Final N (line 35) is a slightly reduced na with a short slanting tail in place of (or, in the second instance, perhaps in addition to) a headmark. Final Ṭ, used in line 36 to avoid the conjunct <foreign>ṭtr</foreign>, looks rather like ṭa, but the right-hand stroke of the headmark is straighter and longer than normal, so I believe it is a tail rather than part of a headmark.</p>
                <p>Original punctuation marks are plain vertical strokes, usually short (sometimes barely more than a dot) and placed at a varying height, but occasionally, and without any apparent system, of the regular length (i.e. as tall, or nearly as tall, as character bodies), especially when doubled. The double bar in line 9 may have some ornamentation.</p>
                <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāras are placed after the character to which they belong, often at median height. They can be moved to the next line as at the beginning of line 13. Visarga is also moved to the next line in l52. There may be an editorial deletion mark in line 33, for which see the apparatus. Jihvāmūlīya occurs in line 42, shaped like a figure-8 (not an hourglass) that is placed inline like a separate character (or like a visarga), not conjoined in a ligature to the following character (see also the apparatus). There is a probable initial R̥ in line 89, but the character is indistinct in the estampage and the reading is determined by the context. It may resemble ḻa in shape.<!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

              <handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00079_hand1">Venkataramanayya observes that plate 3 and onwards may have been written by a different hand, but since the script is identical, this is not certain. I agree that a hand change is probable but. Hand 1 is perhaps slightly neater. In this hand, the upper part of ṇa is a "proper" horizontal figure-8 (e.g. l47 gīrvvāṇa); the marker for dependent au is distinguished from o by the greater height of the second hump (e.g. l6 mahābhaumaḥ); initial A (l11) is close to the classical form resembling sra.</handNote>
              <handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00079_hand2">Hand 2 is perhaps less neat than Hand 1. In this hand, the upper part of ṇa is an open stroke, resembling the o marker (e.g. l53 guṇa); the marker for dependent au is not clearly distinguished from o, though its tail may descend further than that of o (e.g. l54 ravau, śītagau), or it may have a higher rise in the second hump (two instances in line 63); initial A (l56, l65) is a late, cursively simplified form that is similar to initial E.</handNote>

              <note>V's editor in EI suggests that the intent may have been <foreign>svar-</foreign>. This is a very plausible suggestion, but the character on the plate is definitely <foreign>syu</foreign>, and not <foreign>sva</foreign> or <foreign>sū</foreign>. Although the loop of the ostensible subscript <ref>y</ref> (as e.g. in line 15, <foreign>nyu</foreign>) is not visible here, compare <foreign>vyā</foreign> in the next line, where the subscript <foreign>y</foreign> is clear and hardly loops at all to the left. (And with that in turn, compare <foreign>pyara</foreign> for <foreign>pura</foreign> at the end of the present line: the engraver clearly had an issue with subscript <foreign>y</foreign> and dependent <foreign>u</foreign>.) The reading is confirmed by the parallel stanza IV of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00049.xml">Raṇastipūṇḍi grant of Vimalāditya</ref> and stanza IV of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00078.xml">Korumelli grant of Rājarāja I</ref>. Nonetheless, <foreign>syur viṣaya-grāhiṇas</foreign> is quite awkward and insipid, so the stanza as originally composed may well have had <foreign>svar-viṣaya-grāhiṇas</foreign>.</note>

              <note>V prints <foreign>nuḥ</foreign> in round parentheses, which is used in EI for emendation (and is used appropriately in the name <foreign>kujja-viṣṇavarddhano</foreign> earlier in this line), while printing <foreign>siṁ</foreign> at the end of the line in square brackets. The plate is badly corroded after <foreign>ya</foreign>, but I feel quite certain that this is followed by a final <foreign>T</foreign> and a punctuation mark, not by the conjunct <foreign>tta</foreign>. After that, two characters are wholly indistinct. I find V's <foreign>tat-sūnuḥ</foreign> doubtful and believe that <foreign>tad-anu</foreign> may be more likely, but accept his reading since he had the actual estampage in hand.</note>

It seems to me that the sign V read here as a superfluous <foreign>visarga</foreign> must have indicated in some way, perhaps paired with another sign that is not visible in the estampage, that <foreign>naṁdana</foreign> is to be deleted. The sign, in the estampage, resembles a Latin capital G with a gap in the middle of the semicircle on the left, or perhaps a capital C with a gap in the middle and a dot inside it.</note>

Next, the <foreign>s</foreign> of <foreign>syā</foreign> is also malformed. The following <foreign>de</foreign> is faint, while <foreign>śa</foreign> is very small and is lowered so that its headmark is at median height. Probably, <foreign>ādeśaṁ</foreign> was first engraved (eyeskip), then <foreign>de</foreign> was changed into <foreign>la</foreign>, utilising the head, shoulder and perhaps part of the vowel mark to create the new character (the horizontal stroke below <foreign>la</foreign> being the bottom of the original <foreign>de</foreign>). The shape of the original <foreign>śa</foreign> is perhaps discernible in the following malformed <foreign>s</foreign>, and the original <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> may be there after <foreign>syā</foreign>.

              <note>I accept V's reading of the last character in line 88, which he prints as clear. Howeve, I'm inclined to think that what seems to be a vertical stroke on the right is rather the crease at the raised edge, and if so, then the character is probably not <foreign>ṣa</foreign>. Most likely, it might be <foreign>ra</foreign>, but <foreign>dha</foreign> and <foreign>ka</foreign> also seem possible, and an <foreign>ā</foreign> may be attached. In the next line, the plate is cracked from the hole to the edge. The lower parts of characters can to some extent be made out below the crack. The first character in line 89 seems to have a smaller tight curve and a large semicircle below it, the combination suggestive of <foreign>kṣa</foreign>, but far from decisive. (Something with a subscript <foreign>r</foreign> may also be possible, but I would expect a more angular stroke there.) I recognise nothing in the next two characters, but what remains of the fourth looks much like the body of <foreign>sa</foreign>, possibly <foreign>na</foreign> or <foreign>ṇa</foreign>. The remnants of the fifth character strongly imply a subscript <foreign>t</foreign>. Given the dual ending of <foreign>padātyoḥ</foreign>, I expect a word meaning "horseman" or "cavalry" before that. Thus, <foreign>sapti</foreign> is a feasible restoration; alternatively, the fifth character may perhaps be <foreign>śva</foreign> or <foreign>śvi</foreign>. If V is correct to read <foreign>ṣa</foreign> at the end of line 88, then <foreign>pañcaṣaṣṭi</foreign> is the most plausible restoration from that end, but the vestiges counterindicate this, and such a precise (and small) number would be strange in the context. The lost chunk may have included a unit (such as "regiments") which the numeral and the compound with <foreign>-padātyoḥ</foreign> would have qualified, but if <foreign>sapti</foreign> is correct, then no plural nominal ending would fit the metre. All in all, I cannot venture any restoration other than something meaning "cavalry" in the lacuna.</note>

It is possible that V read the lowest component as <foreign>ḷ</foreign> (misprinted as <foreign>l</foreign> in his edition), but for this to be possible, we must read <foreign>°nāṇṭa</foreign> instead of <foreign>°nāṇṭi</foreign> in the next line, taking the curved stroke above that <foreign>ṇṭ</foreign> to be the distinctive end of <foreign>ḷ</foreign> here, rather than an <foreign>i</foreign> marker.</note>

The required number of syllables is only a hair more than that required in the preceding lines for the known <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanzas, and the last five lines of the plate do appear to be written in smaller and tighter script than the rest. The first character in line 120 does not seem to be <foreign>pā</foreign>. It may perhaps be <foreign>pe</foreign> or <foreign>po</foreign>, but if I am correct that the text is metrical, then these are inappropriate.
