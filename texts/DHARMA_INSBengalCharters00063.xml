              <p>The script, which is identical on plate and seal, is a variety of Late Eastern Brāhmī that may palaeographically be assigned to about the 6th century CE. Among noteworthy features, I may mention the following. Vocalization <foreign>ā</foreign> is without exception in the form of a hook open toward the right placed on top of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign>, not recorded by <bibl>
                  <ptr target="bib:Dani1986_01"/>
                </bibl> but well attested in Bengal epigraphy, for instance in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00002.xml">Kotalipada plate</ref>. For vocalization <foreign>ī</foreign>, we consistently find a shape, not represented by <bibl>
                  <ptr target="bib:Dani1986_01"/>
                </bibl>, which is formed by a wave first moving upwards, then turning downward and finally slanting again in upward direction, again a feature shared with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00002.xml">Kotalipada plate</ref>. The <foreign>akṣara</foreign>s <foreign>ka</foreign> and <foreign>ra</foreign> have long descenders; <foreign>ṣa</foreign> and <foreign>sa</foreign> are clearly distinct, <foreign>ṣa</foreign> being based on the shape of <foreign>pa</foreign>; the shape of <foreign>ya</foreign> is always tripartite, consistently with an outward curl at the left extremity. By contrast with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00002.xml">Kotalipada plate</ref>, the shape of <foreign>ha</foreign> is here consistently one that resembles the type <q><foreign>ha</foreign> with its base dipping down</q> (<bibl>
                  <ptr target="bib:Dani1986_01"/>
                  <citedRange unit="page">289</citedRange>
                </bibl>). The shape of <foreign>dh</foreign> has a pronounced dent in the left bulge, a type not recorded by <bibl>
                  <ptr target="bib:Dani1986_01"/>
                </bibl>. The opening symbol is that which current scholarship considers to represent the word <foreign>siddham</foreign> (see <bibl>
                  <ptr target="bib:Griffiths+Southworth2007_01"/>
                  <citedRange unit="page">352</citedRange>
                </bibl>, note 10 for references); the final fleuron is a variant of the wheel motif (<bibl>

                  <citedRange unit="page">58</citedRange>
                </bibl>), the best parallel known to me being found in a late-8th-century inscription of Campā in modern Vietnam (<bibl>
                  <ptr target="bib:Griffiths+Southworth2011_01"/>

                </bibl> (<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00088.xml">Khalimpur Plate</ref>, line 55) as ‘ready to obey our commands’.</q>. Here we suggest three other understandings of this expression. The first possibility is to supply an other word instead of the 'king's consent' and to assume it is the hearing of the prescribed <foreign>mantra</foreign>s that must be recited during the gift-ceremony. The second possibility is to translate it as an adverbial accusative in the sense of <q>according to the <foreign>śruti</foreign><supplied reason="explanation">or Vedic texts</supplied></q> (<bibl>
                <ptr target="bib:MonierWilliams1899_01"/>
              </bibl> : <foreign>nimitta</foreign><q><foreign>in fine compositi</foreign> caused or occasioned by</q> and <foreign>śravaṇa</foreign><q>the act of hearing, also 'that which is heard' equals <foreign>śruti</foreign>-</q>). Finally, considering two specific meanings of each member of the coumpound - <foreign>nimitta</foreign> as omen and <foreign>śravaṇa</foreign> as the name of the 20th (or 23rd) <foreign>nakṣatra</foreign> presided over by Viṣṇu -, the expression <foreign>śravaṇanimittam</foreign> could be understand 'under the sign of Śravaṇa' and could express the time during which the transation should be made. In order to choose between these several meanings, one could take a look on the procedure of making gift described in the <title>Agnipurāṇa</title>, chapter 209. The verses 209.49cd-50 mention what the donor and the donee should say. The verses 209.56-63 detail the qualities of the donee, the auspicious place and time for the gift. This latter is defined by the position of the moon and the sun in the sky (<title>Agnipurāṇa</title> 209.57 : <foreign>somārkagrahaṇasaṅkrāntyādau ca kālake</foreign> 'in a darkness <supplied reason="explanation">moment</supplied> as the passage or the eclipse of the moon or the sun etc.'). Finally the verses 209.61-63 quotes the formula which should be recited. And the chapter 209 ends on this sentence : <foreign>anena dānavākyena sarvadānāni vai dadet</foreign> 'One must give all gifts by using this sentence of donation'. As this source belongs to <foreign>smr̥ti</foreign> literature and as the words to be recited are not coming from the Veda, the translation 'in the occasion the hearing of the prescribed <foreign>mantra</foreign>s' could be accepted whereas the one 'according to the <foreign>śruti</foreign>' is less likely. As the verses 209.49cd-50 of the <title>Agnipurāṇa</title> prescribe the time of the gift according to the planet positions, as the <foreign>pāda</foreign> 209.48d specifies that Viṣṇu is the presiding deity of all things given <supplied reason="explanation">
                <foreign>sarveṣāṃ viṣṇudevatā</foreign>

                <quote>The political condition of Pupdravardhana after the mid-sixth century is unclear, due to the lack of contemporary sources. It can be surmised retrospectively from the inscriptions of the ninth century that this sub-region also experienced some tendencies witnessed in the other sub-regions.</quote>
              </cit> The inscription nicely confirms Furui’s surmise.</note>
                     The name of the ruling sovereign (<foreign>mahā-rājādhirāja</foreign>) Pradyumnabandhu was not previously known from any historical sources, as far as I am aware. His name, with suffix <foreign>bandhu</foreign>, seems somewhat unusual for an Indian king, and may be intended as a synonym of Kr̥ṣṇa. It is perhaps no coincidence that the <title>Harivaṁśa</title> and several purāṇic sources situate in Koṭīvarṣa-Bāṇapura, an important site in the religious landscape of ancient Puṇḍravardhana, <cit>
              <quote>a conflict between <hi rend="italic">Śaiva</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vaiṣṇava</hi> forces, centring around the mythological Bāṇa, the demon king ruling the city</quote>

            </bibl>). That said, there is nothing in the text of the inscription that obliges us to assume that Pradyumnabandhu’s center of power was in Puṇḍravardhana. His capital may have been elsewhere, as was that of the Gupta kings, and this is perhaps suggested by the fact that his appointee Cellaka is stated to have been serving as governor (<foreign>uparika</foreign>) in this province (<foreign>bhukti</foreign>), still quite in the style of all the locally found inscriptions of the Gupta period. This Cellaka and the great chamberlain (<foreign>mahāpratīhāra</foreign>) named Avadhūta are, just as their sovereign Pradyumnabandhu, entirely unknown from other historical sources.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to be any more precise about the date of the present inscription than to say that it most likely dates after the complete dissolution of Gupta power in North Bengal, i.e. after 544 CE, and that it is unlikely, from palaeographic perspective, to be later than 650.

          <p>The name of the district (<foreign>viṣaya</foreign>), Ghoṇādvīpikā, suggests that Ghoṇā might have been the name of a river, an assumption that could be supported by a passage from the <title>uttarabhāga</title> of the <title>Liṅgapurāṇa</title> that figures several names of Śākta deities at least two of which known to be names of rivers: <cit>

              </bibl>. Yuko Yokochi points out to me that <foreign>śoṇā</foreign> might be the river Son, though it is usually denoted by the masculine noun <foreign>śoṇa</foreign>.</note>
                         However, it is also possible that <foreign>ghoṇā</foreign> here has its lexical meaning of ‘nose’ or ‘beak’, and that we are dealing with a descriptive toponym ‘nose island’, perhaps suggestive of the shape of a formation in the landscape. I am unable to identify the precise location of this, or any of the other principal place names, on a map. </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it must be noted that the village whose donation, ‘along with its citron grove’ (if <foreign>bījapūrakavr̥nda</foreign> is not itself a toponym), is the object of this record is called Mastakaśvabhra, while two place names in -<foreign>śvabhra</foreign> and even a specific name landscape indication <foreign>bījapūraka</foreign>, are also found in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00088.xml">Khalimpur plate of Dharmapāla</ref> (<bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Kielhorn1896-1897_03"/>
              <citedRange unit="line">30-39</citedRange>
            </bibl>), in the context of a village Krauñcaśvabhra that lay in <foreign>śrīpuṇḍravardhana-bhukty-antaḥpāti-vyāghrataṭī-maṇḍala-sambaddha-mahantāprakāśa-viṣaya</foreign> ‘the district Mahantāprakāśa forming part of the Vyāghrataṭī circle of the Śrī Puṇḍravardhana province’. I do not find toponyms in -<foreign>śvabhra</foreign> in any other inscriptions of Bengal, and hence infer that this element may have been in vogue for forming toponyms only on a local level. Since the find-spot of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00088.xml">Khalimpur plate</ref> lies within a few miles from the citadel of Gaur (cf. <bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Bhattasali1935_01"/>
              <citedRange unit="page">76</citedRange>
            </bibl>), there is reason to explore the possibility that the places intended in that plate — as well as ours — lay in the same area.</p>
          <p>Landscape indicators or toponyms including the word <foreign>śālmalī</foreign> (here, line 17) are also observed in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00084.xml">Mallasarul</ref> (line 7) and <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00088.xml">Khalimpur</ref> plates (line 37). The element <foreign>joṭā</foreign> (or derivatives), indicating some kind of waterway or canal, is found repeatedly in the cited passage of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00088.xml">Khalimpur plate</ref>, as also in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00084.xml">Mallasarul</ref> (line 7) and <ref target="DHARMA_INSCBengalCharters00003_insc.xml">Ghughrahati</ref> plates (lines 18–19). The word <foreign>trighaṭṭikā</foreign> (line 17) is also found in <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00080.xml">Faridpur plate #2</ref> (lines 23–24), but Pargiter’s translation ‘three ghats’ does not fit in our context, and it seems Trighaṭṭikā must be a hydronym.</p>
          <p>The toponym Audumvarika, which underlies the derivative adjective <foreign>audumvarikeya</foreign> in line 9, may have been the same as the <foreign>viṣaya</foreign> named Audumvarīka in the Vappaghoshavata grant of Jayanāga (<bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Barnett1925-1926_01"/>
              <citedRange unit="line">3</citedRange>
            </bibl>). It may further be asked whether Śivanagara (line 7) is identifiable with the aforementioned important <hi rend="italic">Śaiva</hi> site at modern Bāṇgaḍh (<bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Yokochi2013_01"/>
            </bibl>, <bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Bakker2014_01"/>
            </bibl>), and whether Varāhakoṭṭaka (line 8) might be connected with the series of Vaiṣṇava foundations recorded in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00053.xml">Damodarpur plates #4</ref> and <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00056.xml">#5</ref> (<bibl>

              <citedRange unit="page">92-3</citedRange>
            </bibl>). If so, it is necessary to assume that the administrative situation has changed vis-à-vis the Gupta period, when those sites lay in Koṭīvarṣa-district; in our plate, all toponyms mentioned in connection with the notables etc. are explicitly stated to lie within the Ghoṇādvīpa district (lines 2–3).</p>
