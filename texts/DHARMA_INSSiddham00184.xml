Shastri and Gupta's edition is referred to as SG, Shrimali's edition as Shri. Shrimali's edition is based on SG, but does not appear to be 100% identical - perhaps it represents another stage in Shastri's work. In my notes I only refer to Shri separately when that edition differs from SG.
-->
        <!--
SG's commentary (Shastri_Gupta_1983a:108) says "The characters, like those of practically all the Vākāṭaka records[p114n1: Pune plates of PvG are the only known exception], belong to the box-headed variety of the Central India alphabets with southern peculiarities and share the general character of those employed for the other records of the time of Pravarasēna II." I disagree; even to my poor palaeographic eye, this script looks later and more "southern" than any Vākāṭaka plate I have yet seen. Subscript y-s have a peculiar rounded form (with the same curve as a subscript r) [this form of subscript y also occurs in the Miregaon plates, #IN00185, but not all the time there. Shastri-Kawadkar_2000:136 say the Miregaon plates are palaeographically very similar to the Riddhapur plates so recheck those too for this form. Note also that the Miregaon plates vary several forms of some other letters too]. Dha has little buttocks like in later southern scripts. ja is rounded. ba has a notch on the left-hand side and possibly on the bottom too. Is this an attempt by a later person to imitate Vākāṭaka script? Yes, this is pretty much what Vajpeyi_1988 says, though I don't entirely egree with his reasoning (e.g. his problems "why the engraving began with the second side of the first plate" and "why no proper system was adopted for engraving identical number of lines on them" are not problems at all).
-->
        <!--
Also, in the photos, most characters on some plates seem to have ghosts: the lines of a character have fainter shadows to the left of the actual line. I'm not sure if this is an artefact of bad photography (long exposure and a slight movement of the plate or the camera) or if these characters were scratched onto the plate and then engraved not over, but next to the scratches. Probably the former.

l. i-ii. SG read driṣṭi first (noting that it is in the margin) and siddham second, taking it as a regular part of line 1. But siddham is slightly higher than l1, and all regular lines begin at the same horizontal position after the right-hand edge of siddham. So in my interpretation siddham and driṣṭi are in a separate block at the top left. Also, SG read siddhaṁ, though the halanta M is clear.

L20. SG read śata-traya, emending to trayaṁ and noting that traya was first engraved as naṣya, but part of the subscript n is visible. This is quite certainly not the case, though my reading is very shaky. After śa, tā is certain and very clear, but the ā mātrā could be post- or pre-correction. The next character has something on top that must be an i mātrā, but it is not a proper one, being horizontally narrow and not looping back to the left of the character. This could be explained if this mātrā is post-correction, and the ā mātrā of tā was already in place. The body of the character looks like n, but it has a little stroke slanting down to the left, so it could be a badly formed tt or, more likely, a correction from n to tt. Finally, it has a bottom part which definitely looks like a subscript r, but I am certain that there is more to it, faintly but distinctly visible in the plate in Shastri_1997. This faint line turns the bottom part into the peculiar circular form of subscript y used throughout this inscription. My best guess is that it was first inscribed as nya, then changed into ttri by erasing part of the subscript y, adding a stroke for a lower t, and adding an i mātrā at the top. The problem with this interpretation is that there seems to be a faint vertical line through the entire character, from the erased left-hand line of the subscript y all the way to the top, where it connects with the left-hand side of the apparent i mātrā. Proceeding to the next character, it does look like a plausible ya right now, but it has a c-like little curve below it. This curve is absolutely nothing like any part of a subscript y, so the pre-correction form cannot have been ṣya, but it could very well have been ṣṭa. Finally, there is a definite visarga following the character. I believe that an original śatāny aṣṭa was changed to śata-ttriyaḥ (for śata-ttrayam). Increasing the amount of land would intuitively make more sense, but the subscript y of nya is so faint that it must have been erased (beaten or sanded out), so it must be part of the pre-correction form.
--><!--
L20. SG read bhāryya-mahādevi, emending to bhāryyā. But the first character is absolutely not bh; it's a or, possibly but less likely, su (or even, but unlikely, "8" corrected to a or su). So I think the intent was āryya-mahādevī.
--><!--
L20. SG emend to mahādevīṁ vijñāpyāpratigrāhi(naś). This seems to make no sense. I think the intent was mahādevī-vijñaptyā, and we'd expect dattāni, atisr̥ṣṭāni or something equivalent at this point, but the word was omitted. I do not supply such a word because its gender agreement would be governed by the problematic corrected word earlier in this line. A sentence would end here, and we'd have a new sentence starting with pratigrāhinaś, rather than the awkward apratigrāha thing, which would make even less sense here than it might in #IN00183:20. SG may in fact have thought about vijñapti as I do, in spite of their edited text, since in their summary of the content (Shastri_Gupta_1983a:110) they say "given at the request of the chief queen ..." They do, however, insist on apratigrāha (ibid), "Mahāpurusha who is described as the non-acceptor of donations (apratigrāhin)", which is plainly wrong, since the word is in the plural and obviously serves as the commencement of the list of names.

L28. SG note that this line is "boldly engraved as compared to other lines." This is not at all apparent on either facsimile that I have. However, the characters do seem more widely spaced here, and not as confidently and prettily formed as the rest of the plate. Also, now that I think about it, the subscript y in dhye is a regular type, completely unlike the circular subscript y-s elsewhere in the document. Add to this that long ī mātrās are not used anywhere in the text but here, where we have two specimens. So I am practically certain that this line is in a different hand than the rest. Probably it was left blank to fill out later - though, just possibly, earlier content may have been thoroughly erased here, as SG note in their commentary that only 19 names (plus Mahāpuruṣa, if that is a name) are listed, while l29 talks about 25 plots.
--><!--
L28. SG read rājatintiṇika, which I accept apart from correcting to ntī, which is clear (especially in the photo in #Shastri_1997). The character they read as ja is also problematic; it is quite faint and does not really look like ja. It could perhaps be ṅgā or bdha or ṭṭha, but these are no more likely than the simpler ja.

L29. SG read brāhmaṇaṇa, but there is no r. The two ṇa-s are true; the second is slightly pushed downward by the bottom of the hole and followed by a small space. They do not attemt to restore or interpret bāhmaṇaṇa devāśesyaha and do not see a problem with vvāṭaka (which they space from pañcaviṁśatyā). In their commentary (Shastri_Gupta_1983a:110) they say "The land was divided in all into twenty-five house-sites (vāṭaka)". I have no plausible reconstruction for the whole passage and can only offer the following suggestions. brāhmaṇaṇa is probably meant to be brāhmaṇānāṁ, though brāhmaṇena is also a possibility, closer to the inscribed text but apparently less appropriate in the context. devāśesyaha, I think, involves aṁśa and either saha or iha (devāṁśasyeha? devāṁśena saha? devy-aṁśena saha?). As for vvāṭaka, the doubling must be due to a preceding anusvāra, even if it is not actually there in the plate. So the intent would have been °viṁśatyāṁ vāṭakaḥ. Also, this bit talks about the aparpārśva of the village, while the beginning of the executive part had aparottara-pārśva. So maybe we have cultivable plots in the NW and separate house sites in the W? Or this is not about 25 plots, but another village, called something like pañcaviṁśatyā-vāṭaka? And, as Vajpeyi_1988 points out, the term could very well refer to a cluster of villages, like pravaraśvara-ṣadviṣati-vāṭaka in #IN00160:8.

L31. SG read pūrvyathajñāyā. The character after vya is ma, not tha. The space after that, not noted by SG, may contain a deleted character; all that is visible is a short horizontal at headline height, like the top side of a boxhead. I would conjecture that pūrvyamayā was first inscribed, as in #IN00168 (pūrvvamayā there). I restore to the standard pūrvvayājñayā, but pūrvvam ājñayā may have been the intent. The ā of jñā after the space is not complete, it only curves to the top, but not over the top to the front.

L31. yitavyā is inscribed in the bottom margin, starting below ma (of the problematic bit) and ending before the first jñā. SG's edition numbers this addition separately, as line 32, so subsequent lines in my edition bear a number one less than they do in SG's. The plate in Shastri_1997 numbers the lines as I do, with l32 at the top of 4verso.

L43. SG read senāpato kātyāṇādayo, emending to senāpati-kātyānādayo. The omission of ya after yā (both in SG and Shri) seems to be a typo. I'm pretty sure we should emend to senāpatau kātyāyane, but not certain at all about the next bit, which may or may not belong here. In any case, the vowel mātrā between ṇ and d certainly belongs to d, so its ṇade, not ṇāda. The next character does look like ya, but it is not a proper ya and was probably corrected; the right-hand limb is much fainter. We'd expect likhitam somewhere around here.
--><!--
L43. I keep SG's reading of sakhā. sa is clear, but the next character is malformed. The alleged ā mātrā is very vague in the photos and may not exist at all. The body of the character does not have a box at the bottom, just a horizontal stroke extending from the stem, and a very short vertical extending down from the end of the horizontal (so we have the left and top sides of the box) - rather like a mirrored £ sign without the cross-stroke and with a little vertical extension at the bottom. SG emend to sva (no emendation in Shri), which is probably what this was intended for. Or: can it be that we have a second name here? senāpatau kātyāyane devasakha-mukhājñaptiḥ?
--><!--
L43. and now for something completely different: a bit from the middle of the eṣyat-kāla thing.

L44. For vijñāpayivyā, SG read vijñāpayitavyā (which is wrong, though it is not entirely impossible that this vyā has been corrected to ta, but then vyāsa gets shortened by a vyā) and emend to vijñāpayitavyāḥ (Shri to °vyaḥ), which does not match the standard text.

L46. SG read hantuf pibati but I don't think there is an upadhmānīya here, just a tiny speck of noise above the boxhead of p. Shri reads hantuḥ pibatiḥ, which may in fact be right: there are faint visarga-like marks after both ntu and ti. I apply benefit of doubt and assume the one after ntu is a visarga, while the second is noise.

L47. SG in their initial edition read triṁśad, later (Shastri_Gupta_1984) correcting to viṁśad. They note that these characters are very faint - but they are perfectly clear in the facsimile (is this because the facsimile was retouched by hand? hopefully not).
