There is, however, quite a bit of space, badly damaged, at the end of l4, so one or both characters of vini may actually have been there.

L6. At the beginning of v7c Bühler reads [#ru](dra)senaf; Mirashi convincingly argues for reading/restoring the name as sarvvasena. He prints (sarvva)senaḥ; I believe upadhmānīya is more likely than visarga. The prosody of the line is quite different from Kielhorn's schema for this metre.

L7. M reads (satputraḥ) before pārtthivendrasya, noting that "this word was omitted in all previous transcripts". Nothing is discernible in the facsimile, and satputraḥ is quite incompatible with what we expect by way of metre. B suggests tanayas tasya for the lacuna, which is not impossible: it might fit in the space, and although we'd expect a light syllable in place of "yas t", there are other instances in these verses where a nominative ending followed by a consonant passes for a light syllable, as if these guys pronounced tanaya tasya instead of tanayas tasya.

L7. B and M both read kuntalendraṁ vi(jitya), but neither the anusvāra nor jitya are discernible, and I'm pretty certain vijitya is their conjecture, not their actual reading. It is, however, probably unmetrical; we'd expect a double consonant after vi, followed by a light syllable. Given that the genealogy likes to pun on names (and I buy Mirashi's Vindhyasena in the next quarter), I think vindhya would be a good guess for the word beginning with vi.

L7. At the beginning of v8d, B reads (pr̥)thivī(ṣeṇaḥ). I follow Mirashi, whose arguments for Vindhyasena at this point seem convincing. Beyond that, śrī vi does look more likely from the facsimile than thivī, and there doesn't seem to be enough space for more than 4 characters after vi in v8c, while in B's reading we'd need at least four characters including his °jitya to complete pāda c, then pr̥, and possibly even some space before pr̥. The characters ndhyase are sort of recognisable in Mirashi's rubbing, though not in Indraji's one. Mirashi prints śrīvindhyasenaḥ as clear.

The next two characters after that are very unclear in both rubbings, and to me the second looks much more like su than ra in M's rubbing. Can this be sasuto? And construe lokagurau with something else? And possibly read dharmmaḥ (or dharmmāṁ, agreeing with kārām?). The word kārā is also opaque, as noted by both B and M.

L22. I can't see how four syllables can fit before surendra in l22. There seems to be room for no more than one syllable. But the metre is practically certain from the extant bits, so we do need that many syllables, unless some of them are at the end of l21. Also, the following lines also need quite a bit at the beginning, so maybe it's just that more and more is lost at the beginning as we approach the bottom

L22. B reads ...ha(ṁ) yathepsita in v22c and correctly shows an illegible syllable after that. Mirashi reads janair yathepsitaṁ (emending to yathepsitaM) and puts the end of the verse here - but this would be unmetrical, and there is at least one character after ta. His janair is possible but far from clear; also, I'd expect a doubling of y after r. Indraji's facsimile has a pretty clear kha before ye, and kha is not impossible from Mirashi's rubbing either. I'd tentatively read makha(ṁ) or m(u)kha(ṁ) instead of janair.

I think the reading could be virohaṇe instead of virocane, but that still isn't very good unless it's used instead of adhirohaṇe, which would be unmetrical.
