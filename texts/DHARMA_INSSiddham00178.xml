L3. Mirashi prints ṭakānāṁ as clear and notes "these three aksharas are fairly clear". ṭa is not impossible, but nor is it recognisable in either facsimile. Mirashi tentatively supplies uddhr̥ta-kaṇṭakānāṁ, which sounds good.

L4. Mirashi prints bhivāda is tentatively read, but the characters are clear except for the i, which is probably there, but is reduced to fit into the space below bhū in l3.

L4. The space may be to accommodate ke in l3, but that character does not really hang down into this line. However, the vowel of lī in l5 does come up quite a bit, so if the text was chalked/painted before being engraved, this space may be to accommodate that ī.
--></lg>
<lg n="5" met="upajāti"><!--
The two extant lines are pure upendravajrā, but since we have a string of upajātis, this verse is also identified as upajāti. There are a few other stanzas below, pure indra/upendravajrā (e.g. v15), which are also classified as upajāti for the same reason.
-->

L5. Both B and M print vini as unclear, but nothing of these characters is recognisable in the facsimiles. Also, there is very little space before rjji in the line, and some of that is compromised by ra hanging down from l4. There is, however, quite a bit of space, badly damaged, at the end of l4, so one or both characters of vini may actually have been there. (So far, each verse has occupied exactly one line, but that breaks later on, so it may have broken here too.)
--><!--
L5. Both B and M print rji, but the double j appears quite clear in Indraji's facsimile.
--><!--
L5. B reads kāryyaś cakāra; Mirashi's kāryye seems much better. What B read as ś is probably just a slightly large boxhead, and the e mātrā is plausible.

<lg n="6" met="gītikā"><!--
The metre has been discussed by several scholars (see references in metadata table); Venkatasubbiah calls it Gītikā, but I am not sure this should be adopted. The same(?) metre also occurs in IN00111, Tusam Rock Inscription of Somatrata.

L5. B prints ari as unclear, M prints it as supplied.

If I analyse the metre correctly, the correct reading must be kiraṇalīḍha, not kiraṇālīḍha.

L6. At the beginning of v7c Bühler reads [#ru](dra)senaf; Mirashi convincingly argues for reading/restoring the name as sarvvasena. He prints (sarvva)senaḥ; I believe upadhmānīya is more likely than visarga. The prosody of the line is quite different from Kielhorn's schema for this metre.
-->
<l n="d">jita-sarvva-senas suto bhavaT</l><!--
L6. The halanta T is a very small subscript character but not simplified.

<l n="a"><lb
n="7"/><gap reason="illegible" precision="low" quantity="4" unit="character"/> pārtthivendrasya</l><!--
L7. M reads (satputraḥ) before pārtthivendrasya, noting that "this word was omitted in all previous transcripts". Nothing is discernible in the facsimile, and satputraḥ is quite incompatible with what we expect by way of metre. B suggests tanayas tasya for the lacuna, which is not impossible: it might fit in the space, and although we'd expect a light syllable in place of "yas t", there are other instances in these verses where a nominative ending followed by a consonant passes for a light syllable, as if these guys pronounced tanaya tasya instead of tanayas tasya.
-->
<l n="b"><unclear cert="low">pra</unclear>śa<unclear cert="low">śā</unclear><unclear>sa</unclear> dharmmeṇa medinī<unclear>M</unclear></l><!--
L7. Mirashi reads praśaśāsa as clear, while B prints only śā as unclear. I see nothing apart from śa. The reading fits the metre and is probably correct.
--><!--
L7. there may, possibly, be a halanta M at the end of v8b; B and M both print (m), not (ṁ).
-->
<l n="c">kuntalendra<unclear cert="low">ṁ</unclear> vi<supplied reason="lost" cert="low"><!-- CHECK if <unclear> applies better.-->ndhya</supplied> <gap reason="illegible" precision="low" quantity="3" unit="character"/></l><!--
L7. B and M both read kuntalendraṁ vi(jitya), but neither the anusvāra nor jitya are discernible, and I'm pretty certain vijitya is their conjecture, not their actual reading. It is, however, probably unmetrical; we'd expect a double consonant after vi, followed by a light syllable. Given that the genealogy likes to pun on names (and I buy Mirashi's Vindhyasena in the next quarter), I think vindhya would be a good guess for the word beginning with vi.
-->
<l n="d"><unclear>śrī vi</unclear><unclear cert="low">ndhyasenaḥ</unclear> <gap reason="illegible" precision="low" quantity="4" unit="character"/> </l><!--
L7. At the beginning of v8d, B reads (pr̥)thivī(ṣeṇaḥ). I follow Mirashi, whose arguments for Vindhyasena at this point seem convincing. Beyond that, śrī vi does look more likely from the facsimile than thivī, and there doesn't seem to be enough space for more than 4 characters after vi in v8c, while in B's reading we'd need at least four characters including his °jitya to complete pāda c, then pr̥, and possibly even some space before pr̥. The characters ndhyase are sort of recognisable in Mirashi's rubbing, though not in Indraji's one. Mirashi prints śrīvindhyasenaḥ as clear.

L10. at the end of v12a, B reads an unclear tasya (putting it at the end of l9, but this is impossible). Mirashi reads unclear samya at the beginning of l10, supplying k to get samyak. Nothing is visible in the facsimile, but given the similarity of B and M's readings, they may have seen something.

L14. The first characters of v17b look like lāmara. B and M transcribe nothing here and lāmara is unmetrical. Perhaps lamara? lā seems to use a simplified l later in this line (but not in e.g. l18). But what is lamara, unless it's alam, in sandhi with quarter a? Lamaka is a name and may also mean "lover, a gallant", but this is tenuous.

It definitely looks like va in Indraji's facsimile, but there are traces below it that may belong to ndu, and Mirashi's reading certainly makes the best sense. Mirashi's rubbing could be ndu, though it looks more like ndra.

L15. At the beginning Mirashi reads .=. jān imān; Bühler does not read anything here. In Indraji's rubbing only two i mātrās are visible, the first, which is probably ī, below the j(ā) of l14, the second below below my tentative ma. In Mirashi's rubbing there does seem to be a pretty clear m, but that is right after the first i mātrā, and if Mirashi wanted to read jān imān there, then there would have been no room for three more characters before that. So, if I accept Mirashi's reading, it must fit with what I see as recorded above. Could this be something + sīmajān?

L15. at the end of v18d M reads nirddeśa-guṇāti..., printing it as clear. Bühler has nothing here. Looking at M's rubbing, I think there is one more character between śa and what he reads as gu.

Looking at M's rubbing though, the characters are almost recognisable, and I think rāja is very unlikely (even though M says it is "fairly clear in the new estampage"); it is almost certainly api, though this sounds a bit lame at the beginning of a verse.

I'm not sure how Mirashi construes his sentence; he seems to translate sahāya-dharmmā as if it were dharmma-sahāyaḥ. The characters dharmmā are only discernible in Indraji's rubbing. The next two characters after that are very unclear in both rubbings, and to me the second looks much more like su than ra in M's rubbing. Can this be sasuto? And construe lokagurau with something else? And possibly read dharmmaḥ (or dharmmāṁ, agreeing with kārām?). The word kārā is also opaque, as noted by both B and M.

His janair is possible but far from clear; also, I'd expect a doubling of y after r. Indraji's facsimile has a pretty clear kha before ye, and kha is not impossible from Mirashi's rubbing either.
