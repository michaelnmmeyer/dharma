L8 matimāN: also very small at baseline, and seems to have a _vertical_ line above it. L12 gotrābhyāM: indistinct. L19 vaseT: small at baseline; may have a fairly long stem upward.</p>
              <p>Original punctuation. l16, a short vertical floating at mid-height. L17 same. The closing symbol appears to be composed of three dots in a triangular arrangement.

            <ptr target="bib:Fleet1891_01"/>
          </bibl>) by which time the plates had been lost, so Fleet worked from Burnell's lithograph. PEM's record says Fleet's edition includes a facsimile, but this does not seem to be the case; CHECK a printed copy of IA20. The present edition by Dániel Balogh is based on a collation of the above editions with the estampages published by Burnell.</p>
