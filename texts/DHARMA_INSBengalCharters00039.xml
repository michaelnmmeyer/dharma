              <p>The script used in this inscription is a variety of late eastern Brāhmī consistent with that observed in other inscriptions of the same period. Among noteworthy features are an archaic shape of 
              <foreign>ṇ</foreign>; the archaic notation of -
              <foreign>ā</foreign>with a downward stroke on the right in 
              <foreign>khā</foreign>, 
              <foreign>go</foreign>, 
              <foreign>jñā</foreign>, 
              <foreign>ṇo</foreign>, 
              <foreign>dhā</foreign>, 
              <foreign>bo</foreign>, 
              <foreign>brā</foreign>, etc.; the fact that 
              <foreign>ṣ</foreign>and 
              <foreign>s</foreign>are not visibly distinguished 
              <supplied reason="explanation">leaving the decipherer to choose whichever is required</supplied>; the fact that medial 
              <foreign>i</foreign>/
              <foreign>e</foreign>and 
              <foreign>ī</foreign>/
              <foreign>ai</foreign>are virtually indistinguishable; the use of ‘final’ consonants 
              <foreign>M</foreign>and 
              <foreign>T</foreign>. Orthographic deviations from the norm include the ones that are too common to deserve further notice (such as inconsistent distinction between 
              <foreign>b</foreign>and 
              <foreign>v</foreign>; doubling of consonants before and after 
              <foreign>r</foreign>), but also repeated spelling of 
              <foreign>n</foreign>for 
              <foreign>ṇ</foreign>. Quite often we must assume involuntary omission of small elements such as 
              <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>, 
              <foreign>visarga</foreign>, 
              <foreign>ā</foreign>- and 
              <foreign>e-mātra</foreign>to achieve a text that makes sense. In other respects, the Sanskrit usage of the text is not too bad, although one example of substandard declensional ending is found 
              <supplied reason="explanation">line 15 
              <foreign>nandabhūtiṣya</foreign></supplied>, and it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that the author has at least once confused singular and plural verb forms

<note>The article of 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Dubey+Acharya2014_01" />
</bibl> was helpful as a starting point for editing the text, but I have not deemed it useful to report any of the numerous variants of reading between my edition and that of the two Indian scholars. I leave it to the interested reader to compare their edition (which is unaccompanied by any translation) with mine and judge the merits of each.

  <note>Instead of

  <foreign>nītika</foreign> could give a similar sense derived from 
  <foreign>nīti</foreign>, but it is imaginable (in view of the ambiguity of the sandhi 
  <foreign>ito n-</foreign>) that the intended word is 
  <foreign>anaitika</foreign>/
  <foreign>anītika</foreign>, while at least the latter option would in turn be susceptible to two interpretations: 
  <foreign>an-ītika</foreign> (see 
  <bibl>

  </bibl>, Dictionary s.v.) and

    <ptr target="bib:Majumdar1929_01" />

  <foreign>pratītadharmmaśīlaśivacandrahastāṣṭakanavakanalenāpaviñchya</foreign>. Perhaps this parallel constitutes an argument for reading 
  <foreign>nītika</foreign>- and interpreting the sandhi as resulting from 
  <foreign>anītika</foreign>- ‘free of calamities’, hence yielding a positive attribute to the geographic qualification 
  <foreign>kuddālakhātika</foreign>. This is the only such geographic definition of a unit of land measurement in the Gupta-period corpus, and the phenomenon is subsequently attested no earlier than in the Sena corpus (cf.

  </bibl> on the terms

<p>The inscription is dated to year 159, Jyeṣṭha day 8. As suggested to me by Michio Yano, whom I thank for his help in dealing with this issue, we may approach the conversion of this date by counting back from the Eran stone pillar inscription of year 165 (
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Bhandarkar1981_01" />
  <citedRange unit="item">39</citedRange>
</bibl>), which gives the earliest date with specification of weekday in the Gupta corpus. The dating parameters of the latter are:
</p>
     
<p>Year: 165</p>
        
<p>Date: Āṣāḍha, 
<foreign>śuklapakṣa</foreign> 12</p>
        
<p>Weekday: Thursday</p>
               
<p>This, according to 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Fleet1891_06" />
  <citedRange unit="page">377</citedRange>
</bibl>, can be converted as:</p>
                 
<p>Year: 484 CE</p>
        
<p>Date: June 21</p>
        
<p>Weekday: Thursday</p>
<p>As  
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Fleet1891_06" />
</bibl> indicates, the year also corresponds to 407 Śaka current 
<supplied reason="explanation">
  <foreign>vartamāna</foreign>
</supplied>. This in turn is equivalent to 406 Śaka elapsed 
<supplied reason="explanation">
  <foreign>atīta</foreign>
</supplied>. The date of the inscription that concerns us here is six years before this:</p>
        
<p>Year: 159</p> 
        
<p>Date: Jyeṣṭha, 8</p>
        
<p>Weekday: not specified</p>
<p>Thus 159 Gupta is 401 Śaka current or 400 Śaka elapsed, i.e. 478/9 CE. </p>
                 
<p>We lack several parameters that would be required to be able to determine with certainty the precise Julian date. The 
<foreign>pakṣa</foreign> (waxing or waning) is rarely specified in any Gupta-period inscriptions, and we do not have any explicit statement at all as to whether the system of month naming was 
<foreign>pūrṇimānta</foreign> or 
<foreign>amānta</foreign>.

</bibl>.
                 </note> It is also uncertain whether the system for day-numbering was continuous 
<supplied reason="explanation">from 1 through 30</supplied> or resumed from 1 at the second 
<foreign>pakṣa</foreign> 
<supplied reason="explanation">1–15+1–15</supplied>. Given these facts, three 
<foreign>prima facie</foreign> equally viable conversions may be obtained using the Pancanga program developed by Michio Yano and Makoto Fushimi (http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/), in which the years are reckoned as 
<foreign>atīta</foreign>:</p>
<p>
<foreign>pūrṇimānta</foreign>: 478 5 11 Thursday, 400 Śaka, Nija-Jyaiṣṭha, 
<foreign>kr̥ṣṇapakṣa</foreign> 8</p>
  
<p>
<foreign>pūrṇimānta</foreign>/
<foreign>amānta</foreign>: 478 5 25 Thursday, 400 Śaka, Nija-Jyaiṣṭha, 
<foreign>śuklapakṣa</foreign> 8 </p>
<p>
<foreign>amānta</foreign>: 478 6 9 Friday, 400 Śaka, Nija-Jyaiṣṭha 
<foreign>kr̥ṣṇapakṣa</foreign> 8 </p>

<p>However, we actually do have reason to assume that the day-counting system was continuous 
<supplied reason="explanation">1–30</supplied>, because day numbers higher than 15 are found in the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00049.xml">Baigram plate</ref> (line 25) and in the Mankuwar image inscription of Kumāragupta I (

  <citedRange unit="item">25</citedRange>
  <citedRange unit="line">2</citedRange>
</bibl>), respectively of 128 and 129 Gupta. Therefore, the third option may be cancelled (because day 8 in a month named in the 
<foreign>amānta</foreign> system would fall in 
<foreign>śuklapakṣa</foreign>). If, furthermore, we accept one of the main results of Fleet’s research (

<cit>
  <quote>the pûrṇimânta arrangement of the lunar fortnights is the one that was used for the Gupta years during the period in which these records were written</quote>
</cit>, then we can narrow down our conversion to Thursday the 11th of May, 478 CE.</p>

<p>As noted above, the plate is dated to year 159 in numeral signs (line 26), but — uniquely in the corpus of early land-sale inscriptions from Bengal — the date is additionally expressed in words (line 6). This date falls during the reign of Budhagupta, and it is certainly this king who is indicated with the synonymous designations paramabhaṭṭāraka and paramadeva. The latter epithet is known to me elsewhere only in the Shankarpur inscription (168 GE, 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Jain1977_01" />
</bibl>) which states (emended): 
<foreign>samvatsara-śate ’ṣṭa-ṣaṣṭy-uttare mahā-māgha-samvatsare śrāvaṇa-māse pañcamyāṁ paramadeva-budhagupte rājani</foreign>. A further epithet used to designate the king in our inscription is 
<foreign>paramadaivata</foreign>. This last term is known to have been used — specifically in the Puṇḍravardhana area (
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Bakker2014_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">242-3</citedRange>
  <citedRange unit="note">689</citedRange>
</bibl>) — by Kumāragupta I, Budhagupta and the king with name ending in -gupta during whose reign the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00056.xml">Damodarpur plate #5</ref> was issued. As shown by 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Sircar1974_03" />
</bibl>, the epithet 
<foreign>paramadaivata</foreign> may but need not have been a synonym of 
<foreign>paramabhāgavata</foreign>, i.e. an indication that the ruler in question was of Vaiṣṇava faith, but may less specifically have designated its bearer as ‘a great devotee of the gods in general or of one of the great gods’.</p>
                  
<p>Despite the absence of explicit mention of the name Budhagupta, this king’s role in the present document is more prominent than in any other Gupta-period inscription of Puṇḍravardhana, none of which are concerned with direct royal intervention in local affairs. The present inscription for the first time provides evidence of a royal land grant in the area, and for the first time gives an impression of how the interests of individual citizens could become caught between policies of local and central administration.</p>
<p>Among other individuals involved in the proceedings recorded in the inscription I may mention first the 
<foreign>kumārāmātya</foreign> named Yūthapati. Although 
<foreign>yūthapa</foreign> in stanza XVIII of the Indian Museum plate of Dharmapāla (
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Furui2011_01" />
</bibl>) — a Puṇḍravardhana inscription of the late 8th or early 9th century — is the name of a function, the otherwise unattested word yūthapati must be a proper name here, as is indicated by the immediate juxtaposition of the term 
<foreign>kumārāmātya</foreign> with proper names in other Gupta-period inscriptions (e.g. 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00047.xml">Damodarpur #1</ref>, line 4; 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00049.xml">Baigram</ref>, line 1).</p>
<p>The highest provincial administrator (
<foreign>uparika</foreign>) at the time of our inscription was named Brahmadatta, no doubt the same as the one who was serving at the time of issue of 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00032.xml">Damodarpur plate #3</ref> (see 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Bakker2014_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">243</citedRange>
</bibl>). It seems necessary to assume the involvement of councils (
<foreign>adhikaraṇa</foreign>) at two levels: that of the 
<foreign>viṣaya</foreign>, led by Yūthapati, and that of a superordinate level whose name is not mentioned in the text, but may naturally be assumed to have been the 
<foreign>bhukti</foreign>, given the involvement of this Brahmadatta.

<p>An officer styled

<head xml:lang="eng">The meaning of 
<foreign>garuṭṭāpa</foreign></head>
<p>One of the most interesting novelties of this inscription is the expression 
<foreign>garuṭṭāpa</foreign> occurring in lines 7 and 11. The expression being unknown elsewhere, it can easily be misread, as was done by 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Dubey+Acharya2014_01" />
</bibl> who read 
<choice>
  <sic>gū</sic>
  <corr>gu</corr>
</choice>ptāpa-. The first 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign> cannot be 
<foreign>gu</foreign>, because the medial 
<foreign>u</foreign> when attached to 
<foreign>g</foreign> normally turns to the right and returns upward (as it does with 
<foreign>tu</foreign> and 
<foreign>bhu</foreign>). The 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign> here is simply 
<foreign>ga</foreign>, as is confirmed by the 
<foreign>ga</foreign> in 
<foreign>bhagavatā</foreign> in line 22, showing exactly the same shape. The 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign>s 
<foreign>ru</foreign> and 
<foreign>U</foreign> are very close to each other in this script — cf. their shapes in 
<foreign>Uktañ</foreign> (line 22) and 
<foreign>varuṇā</foreign> (line 24). While the reading of the third 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign> is difficult in line 7, it is unmistakably 
<foreign>ṭṭā</foreign> in line 11; a hypothetical reading 
<foreign>ga Uṭṭā</foreign> would defy understanding, whereas for my preferred reading 
<foreign>garuṭṭāpa</foreign>, I can offer the following interpretation. I propose to take it as a compound 
<foreign>garuṭ</foreign>+
<foreign>tāpa</foreign>, with 
<foreign>garuṭ</foreign> an apparently unique stem hypostatized from the common words 
<foreign>garuḍa</foreign> and 
<foreign>garut</foreign>-
<foreign>mant</foreign>, and 
<foreign>tāpa</foreign> somehow related to the word 
<foreign>tāpita</foreign> that is commonly found on early Bengal copper plates,
<note>The formula with 
<foreign>likhitaṁ</foreign> and 
<foreign>tāpitaṁ</foreign> is found in the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00034.xml">Jagadishpur plate</ref>, lines 27–28. The 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00031.xml">Dhanaida plate</ref> ends in line 17 after a lacuna with

<foreign>utkīrṇṇaṁ</foreign> stands in the sense of 
<foreign>likhitaṁ</foreign>, and one may speculate that a

<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00063.xml">plate of Pradyumnabandhu’s year 5</ref>, line 18.</note> 
    as it is here in line 25, and for which 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Sircar1966_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">338</citedRange>
</bibl> suggested the meaning: ‘heated 
<supplied reason="subaudible">for affixing the seal to a copper-plate grant</supplied>’. There must then be a connection with the expressions 
<foreign>garutmadaṅka</foreign> and 
<foreign>garuḍājñā</foreign> found elsewhere in Gupta inscriptions (see 
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Raven1994_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">3, 161</citedRange>
</bibl>). It is relevant also that the epithet 
<foreign>garuḍaketuḥ</foreign> is used in the opening 
<foreign>maṅgala</foreign> stanza of the Eran pillar of the reign of Budhagupta, year 165 (
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:Bhandarkar1981_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">340</citedRange>
</bibl>), which although invoking Viṣṇu (
<foreign>caturbhuja</foreign>) on the surface, may perhaps also be read as applying to the king. Hence I propose that 
<foreign>garuṭṭāpa-śāsana</foreign> means ‘a charter with 
<supplied reason="subaudible">the imperial</supplied> Garuḍa seal’, and refer to

It is no coincidence that the expression is in both of its occurrences connected to the issuance of imperial orders, and it is no surprise that our copper-plate itself, which reports on but does not itself represent an imperial charter, bears no Garuḍa emblem on its seal.</p>

<p>Certain examples of toponymic continuity between ancient and modern Bengal are known, such as the place name Vayigrāma which no doubt corresponds to the modern name of an epigraphic find-spot Baigram. However, because I have no first hand knowledge of the field in North Bengal, and do not have access to relevant sources such as detailed maps, I am unable at the time I am preparing this article for publication to provide any identifications of the toponyms mentioned in the inscription — Mahatī-Raktamālā, Khuḍḍī-Raktamālikā, Kuddālakhāta, Govardhanaka, Dugdhotikā and Madhyamaṣaṇḍika — with toponyms of modern Bangladesh or West Bengal.

<p>Still, I may note that the 
<foreign>adhivāsa</foreign> named Kuddālakhāta, where was situated the Mahatī-Raktamālā 
<foreign>agrahāra</foreign> from which the inscription was issued, must correspond with Kuddālakhātaka in the

</bibl>). There, it is likewise the place from which a grant was issued (line 28–29: 
<foreign>kuddāla-khātaka-samāvāsita-śrīmaj-jayaskandhāvārāt</foreign>) but simultaneously the name of a 
<foreign>viṣaya</foreign>, in lines 30–31: 
<foreign>śrī-puṇḍravardhana-bhuktau kuddāla-khātaka-viṣaye nandadīrghikodraṅge sīmā</foreign>. It again figures as name of a
