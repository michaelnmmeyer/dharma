              <p>Halantas. Final N (e.g. l8, l31) is a raised and reduced na-shape with a sinuous tail. Final M (e.g. l11, l25) is a raised circle with a sinuous tail. Final T looks like ta with sinuous tail instead of headmark (e.g. l6), or like a raised and reduced ta with a sinuous tail, almost identical in the unclear facsimile to final N and M (l44, l52).</p>
              <p>Original punctuation marks are double verticals with a pronounced serif.</p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally at head height after the character to which it belongs. Initial Ī occurs in line 49. </p>

<note>KR prints this reading as clear, and it is supported by the parallel stanza in the

<foreign>ā</foreign> attached to the head. It is possible that

<foreign>n</foreign> must be supplied at the end of this segment, both for the metre and for correct sandhi. KR notes that his restorations elsewhere in this stanza are based on a parallel that I am not aware of, see the commentary.</note>

<note>I cannot exclude KR's reading with full confidence, but since it is metrically deficient by two syllables, I find it unconvincing. The space on the plate permits two more characters, provided that the last one before the binding hole is close to the hole's edge and has no descenders. There are, however, no clear indications that the extra characters required by the metre were present on the plate; they may also have been omitted by the scribe. The first character of this stretch is more likely in my opinion to be 
<foreign>c</foreign> than 
<foreign>bh</foreign>. It has no vowel mark on the bottom or left-hand side, but a vowel may have been attached to it at the top. The second character has an illegible subscript component, but none of its body is visible. The third character that I believe would have been present before the hole is also wholly invisible in the facsimile. After the hole, there is a mess of damage wide enough to hide two characters, before coming to 
<foreign>thā</foreign>. Assuming that KR could actually see vestiges of the characters he reads here, the original (or originally intended) text may for instance have been 
<foreign>bhinna-manorathān</foreign>.</note>

<note>KR's 
<foreign>a</foreign> at the end of this locus is probably a typo. His edition prints

<foreign>ātma-</foreign>. Except for the vowel of the (probable) 
<foreign>j</foreign> at the end of line 33, the reading is reasonably clear. See also the note to the translation.</note>

<foreign>n</foreign> looks much more like

<foreign>au</foreign>) than like 
<foreign>i</foreign>. Moreover, a noun in the masculine accusative or neuter nominative is required for my interpetation of the second hemistich, for which see the translation.</note>

<note>KR's reading is unmetrical and in the word he reads as 
<foreign>mātrīṇāṁ</foreign> I find it impossible to read 
<foreign>ī</foreign> and 
<foreign>āṁ</foreign>. At the beginning of this locus, my own reading 
<foreign>prākkāla</foreign> is offered very tentatively as something that may be possible to fit both to the context and to the remnants of characters visible in the facsimile. The first of these three characters is very likely to be 
<foreign>pra</foreign> or 
<foreign>prā</foreign>, but a different principal consonant is not out of the question. Nothing discernible survives of the second, except what may be a vertically attached 
<foreign>ā</foreign> marker at the top right. The arrangement of the faint vestiges suggests that its principal consonant may have been 
<foreign>j</foreign>, but this is very far from decisive. The surviving strokes of the third character look on the surface like a malformed 
<foreign>pa</foreign> or 
<foreign>va</foreign>, but the range of possible readings is much wider. Apart from 
<foreign>prākkāla</foreign>, the text inscribed here may have been 
<foreign>prajñāta</foreign>, 
<foreign>prajñāna</foreign>, 
<foreign>prādhānya</foreign>, 
<foreign>prāmāṇya</foreign>, 
<foreign>prāvīṇya</foreign>,

<note>KR's reading is unmetrical in many details. I am quite confident of my reading and interpretation up to 
<foreign>svaṁ gotraṁ parivarttamānam</foreign>, but cannot offer a plausible reading thereafter. The illegible stretch may begin with a verb or verbal derivative with 
<foreign>anu</foreign>, perhaps in the sense of "imitate" (see also my translation), but 
<foreign>nu</foreign> is not a very likely reading of the first character of that stretch. The next character's body is wholly effaced, but it has a clear and conspicuous marker on the top, in the shape of an inverted S, which may be an alternative stroke for dependent 
<foreign>e</foreign>. Slightly after this there is a shape that strongly suggests the consonant 
<foreign>n</foreign>, but it is not clear whether this is the second or the third character of the illegible stretch. Further on, the vestiges read by KR as 
<foreign>yu</foreign> look more like 
<foreign>ryya</foreign> to me, but other readings (e.g. 
<foreign>sya</foreign>) may be possible. Next, what KR reads as 
<foreign>dhi</foreign> is barely discernible; I prefer 
<foreign>vi</foreign> on the basis of what I can make out of the context. After this, KR's 
<foreign>sthi</foreign> is impossible: apart from 
<foreign>i</foreign> being unmetrical, the subscript consonant is clearly 
<foreign>t</foreign>, while the rest of this character is indistinct.</note>

<note>Although the case is not entirely clear, I am quite confident that this is the beginning of another

<foreign>bhavan</foreign>, but if this is the correct reading, then it probably requires emendation to 
<foreign>bhavad</foreign>. What KR reads as 
<foreign>vī</foreign> is quite clearly 
<foreign>dhi</foreign>, implying that 
<foreign>ni</foreign> must be supplied before this character. KR's 
<foreign>ryya</foreign> is in all probability 
<foreign>ryyā</foreign>, though it may perhaps be a clumsily executed 
<foreign>ryyo</foreign> or 
<foreign>ryya</foreign>. I do not venture to offer a reading for the last two characters on the page, read by KR as

<gap reason="lost" /> enemies, both civilised and uncivilised.
<note>The second quarter of this stanza, part of which is lost, probably said that in addition to Yuddhamalla, Bhīma II also vanquished other enemies, who apparently included people regarded as barbarians.</note></p>

<supplied reason="explanation">Brahmins</supplied>.
<note>The reading and interpretation of part of this stanza is problematic; see also the apparatus to line 33. KR interpreted the text to mean that Amma II was 
<q>born with an ornament-like tissue around his neck</q>, but I agree with his editor (Sircar?), whose footnote says, 
<q>In fact 
<gap reason="ellipsis" /> Amma II was declared heir-apparent even when he was in the womb of his mother</q>.  I translate the text as emended by me, and believe that the composer intended a contrast between the 
<foreign>yuvarāja</foreign>’s locket, which was bestowed on Amma when he had no say in the matter, and the royal turban, which he took as an act of will.</note></p>

<note>Some of this stanza is lost, and some details of the translation may be different from the original composer’s intent. To make sense of the third quarter, I make a tentative emendation (see the apparatus to line 36), believing that the composer had intended to draw a parallel between Amma’s enmity to (and effectiveness against) elephants and that of a lion (conventionally a vanquisher of elephants). As received, the text means that he attained a fondness for elephants. It is also possible that this was after all the composer’s intent, but in this case 
<foreign>siṁhasya</foreign> must be construed with the rest of the fourth quarter (“victorious through a leonine valour”), which would be syntactically awkward.</note></p>

<note>Parts of this stanza are lost, and parts are illegible. It seems that at least part of it is about Dānārṇava, as suggested by

<foreign>agrajanman</foreign> (the former being read with fair confidence, the latter with somewhat less). However, 25 years is the duration of Amma II’s reign, and it seems strange for the text to mention this only after introducing Dānārṇava as Amma’s elder brother. It is also possible that the first hemistich is about Amma II as an elder son (viz., of Bhīma II), and only the second hemistich concerns Dānārṇava.</note></p>

<note>I am not entirely certain about my interpretation of the third quarter of this stanza, but believe that the composer’s idea was what I translate here. For this to work, 
<foreign>preṣita</foreign> must be understood here as a substantive. KR, who apparently analysed the text with 
<foreign>parikṣata</foreign> instead of my 
<foreign>aparikṣata</foreign> (see the apparatus to line 47), may have understood 
<foreign>parikṣata-caro</foreign> as a plural accusative of a kenning for arrow (literally, “that which goes into wounds”); in this case, “going about unwounded” is not part of the message. I find this interpretation more forced and less likely than mine.</note>—the unrivalled King

<supplied reason="explanation">
  <foreign>adhipa</foreign>
</supplied> Coḍa-Bhīma, who was a likeness of Rāvaṇa.
<note>Given the first hemistich, one would expect the stanza to say that Cālukya-Nārāyaṇa laugs at the divine Nārāyaṇa because he does not need a false guise to defeat his enemies. This is indeed how RK summarises the stanza, but I see no way to finding that meaning in the text. The second hemistich is an awkward jumble of words. Most jarringly, it lacks a verbal form to express the action. Moreover, it uses surprisingly flattering terminology 
<supplied reason="explanation">
<foreign>īśa</foreign> and 
<foreign>śrī</foreign></supplied> for the enemy Coḍa-Bhīma, and even though 
<foreign>api</foreign> ought to imply a contradiction (“even though he had first cast down his enemies”), I see no such thing, nor any need for a reference to enemies in general here. Conversely, there is nothing in the second hemistich about Cālukya-Nārāyaṇa doing so in his own form, nor is there a counterpart here to 
<foreign>prāk</foreign>, “in olden days.” The only point where the second hemistich matches the first is that this human Nārāyaṇa defeats an enemy likened to Rāvaṇa, who was defeated by the divine Nārāyaṇa in the form of Rāma. The text on the plate is quite clearly legible and includes only one evident scribal mistake (
<foreign>°āṣāsta</foreign>), where the composer’s original intent is quite straightforward (
<foreign>°āpāsta</foreign>). I wonder if perhaps the fourth quarter belongs originally to a different stanza. Two stanzas may have been either cobbled together badly by a clumsy composer, or a quarter of the first and three quarters of the second may have been omitted by an inattentive scribe.</note></p>

<div type="commentary">
<p rend="stanza" n="3-6">KR prints most of these stanzas as clearly legible, and for restorations at the ends of lines indicates that they are restored 
<q>with the help of the other well-known copper plate grants</q> of the Eastern Cālukyas. As of October 2021, I am aware parallel stanzas in the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00041.xml">Nāgiyapūṇḍi grant of Amma II</ref> and in the 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates of Dānārṇava</ref>. The latter is poorly edited without a facsimile of this plate that would allow verification, so its readings are unreliable. I generally accept KR's readings here, but add my indications of uncertainty and mark up the text as supplied where I find it wholly illegible in the facsimile.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="3">KR, in my opinion, misunderstands this stanza in his discussion, stating first that Vijayāditya III chased Kannara and Śaṅkila into the impregnable country, but then adding in a note that this 
<q>impregnable country was evidently the kingdom of Baddega</q>. He may have done so on the assumption that his restoration 
<foreign>durggamān</foreign> (with sandhi for 
<foreign>durggamāt</foreign>) was a singular ablative qualifying 
<foreign>janapadāt</foreign>, but the much better preserved parallel version clearly reads 
<foreign>durggaman</foreign> (with sandhi for 
<foreign>durggamam</foreign>), which I find to be better in context, establishing a contrast between 
<foreign>janapada</foreign> and 
<foreign>durggama</foreign>.
<note>The 
<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00071.xml">Kaṇḍyam plates of Dānārṇava</ref> reportedly also read 
<foreign>durggamān</foreign>. If this can be confirmed from a facsimile, then the same reading may also be acceptable here, but it should still be construed as a plural accusative (
<foreign>durggamān</foreign> scil. 
<foreign>deśān</foreign>), not a singular ablative.</note> KR’s editor (probably Sircar) also thinks that the badlands are not identical to Baddega’s homeland. KR’s interpretation also states that Guṇaga Vijayāditya 
<q>protected Baddega from fear</q>. However, it can only be Vijayāditya himself who is described here as fearless.</p>
<p>Sandhi-obscured caesura in v12 (śārdūlavikrīḍita) c. The break between pādas c and d is obscured by sandhi in v22 (also śārdūlavikrīḍita).</p>
<p>KR assigns stanza numbers 24 to 28 to the broken text of lines 56 to 62, allocating the end of a stanza to each punctuation mark including the one he reads in line 59 that I cannot make out in the estampage. It is indeed likely that this stretch of text was in verse, but the surviving text is not sufficient to determine its metre(s) or even the locations of stanza ends. I therefore assign stanza number 24 to the first clear remnant of verse beginning in line 63. This is stanza 29 in KR's edition.</p>
