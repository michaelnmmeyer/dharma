              <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally to the right of the character to which it belongs, but may be above it; it is possibly inside the i marker on the next character in l15 vaṁgipaṟu.
                      Retroflex ṇa has a shape that I find unusual, with the left wing bent down to form a closed loop with the top of the body. Doubling of consonants is occasionally omitted after r, e.g. l8 suvarṇa, l19 sarva, pūrvataḥ.
                      In go (end of l1), the left-hand marker is attached to the lower part of the body.

              <note>ARIE reports the name of the village as Nemmalūru. The first character is indistinct in the estampage, but SR's <foreign>go</foreign> appears to be impossible from the vestiges (compare <foreign>go</foreign> in lines 1 and 15). What is visible in the estampage consists of a horizontal line with a downward hook at the left, which is likely an <foreign>e</foreign> marker; a curved stem attaching this stroke to the body on the right-hand edge of the character; and the upper left portion of the body, which resembles a quarter oval. The shape is most reminiscent of a partially preserved <foreign>kha</foreign>, but <foreign>khā</foreign> in line 14 is too damaged to serve for a comparison. Indications for this and against <foreign>ne</foreign> are the curly left end of the upper horizontal stroke (which would probably be less curly if it were an <foreign>e</foreign>) and by the curvature of the vertical stroke (where a straight vertical stem would be expected in <foreign>n</foreign>). These indications are not, however, decisive. I assume that the ARIE editor had a good look at the original plates and was therefore in a better position to judge. Moreover, there is a present-day village Nimmaluru at 16° 16′ 13.08″ N, 80° 59′ 48.12″ E, in Gudivada taluk of Krishna district (so probably in Gudrahāra Viṣaya), though not in West Godavari district, where the inscription is said to have been found. There is a stream (<foreign>koḍu</foreign>?) to the west of this village, but I find no names recognisable from the grant in its vicinity. For these considerations I prefer the reading <foreign>nemmaḷūru</foreign>, but <foreign>khammaḷūru</foreign> may also be correct, and other readings such as <foreign>vemmaḷūru</foreign> cannot be excluded.</note>

              <note>SR prints this reading both in his edition and in his discussion, so it is probably not a typo. If an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is present, then it is inside the circle of <foreign>i</foreign> over <foreign>gi</foreign>.</note>

              <note>The latter half of this word is quite certainly <foreign>boya</foreign>. The first character is uncertain, but definitely not <foreign>ṣe</foreign>, which may be a typo in SR's edition. In addition to <foreign>ce</foreign>, it may be <foreign>co</foreign>, <foreign>kha</foreign> or <foreign>khā</foreign>. The second character does not appear to be <foreign>ṇḍa</foreign>, but that may have been intended if the first character is <foreign>kha</foreign>.</note>

              <note>Being unable to interpret this word, I am uncertain of its reading. The subscript component of the first character is definitely <foreign>ḻ</foreign>. Its vowel marker rises very high above the body before bending down and would imply the vowel <foreign>au</foreign>. There is definitely no second stroke on the left, but the <foreign>au</foreign> of <foreign>pautrikaṁ</foreign> in line 28 may also be written with a single cursive stroke. Nonetheless, <foreign>au</foreign> being unlikely in a vernacular word, the intent was probably <foreign>ā</foreign>; the vowel marker in <foreign>ṣā</foreign> a little further on in this line rises almost as high. The second character is probably <foreign>nda</foreign>, but <foreign>ṇḍa</foreign>, <foreign>nde</foreign> and <foreign>ndo</foreign> are also possible. The third character's consonant component may be <foreign>ḻ</foreign>, but <foreign>ṟ</foreign> is more likely. There seems to be a small vowel marker attached to its body on the right, and there is plenty of space to its left, so I assume that there was a second vowel marker (together for <foreign>o</foreign>) here.</note>
