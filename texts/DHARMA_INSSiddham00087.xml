This inscription seems to be a perfect second half for %IN00086, but I follow Fleet in editing the two as separate. Fleet admits the apparent connectedness of the text but notes (#Fleet_1888:132n3) that "the edges of [%OB00079] are rounded off more; the copper is of a totally different quality, thickness, and weight; and the characters, though of just the same period, differ very much in details of execution ... there can, on the whole, be no doubt that in [%OB00078] and [%OB00079] we have the first and second plates of two separate grants; not one entire grant." The additional dūtaka mentioned at the end of IN00087 may also be an indication that the two plates belong to disparate grants, since there is no mention of halirākara in %IN00086..

Fleet understands rāja-a-bhāvya, "taxes which by custom should not belong to the king". I'm not sure about this but haven't checked. If we take rājā as standing for rāja, then there should be a hyphen at the end of the line.

Fleet reads halirākara . Sircar's glossary [apparently on the basis of this record alone] does include halirākara, "a fiscal term of uncertain implication; probably a mistake for halikā-kara, plough-tax"). The form halikākara does occur (and the reading is clear) in IN00089/10 and /31 (which Fleet was not familiar with). Here, there are two faint marks to the sides of rā in halirā, which may be remnants of the arms of an original kā so I assume that is what we had here. 
--><!-- 
As for kumbha-daṇḍa, daṇḍa looks like dāṇḍa to me. Furthermore, dā is very small and is in contact with both mbha and ṇda, as if an original kumbhā had been corrected to kumbhadā.

Fleet reads pratimecanātilekhine. Ca and nā are completely indistinct in the facsimile. They could be anything. The i mātrā of khi is clear (though a bit different from other i mātrās nearby) but should probably be emended to lekhane, and ati should quite possibly read as abhi, resulting in abhilekhane. Since IN00089/31 has a (differently corrupt) variant on abhilekhane, I assume that to be the original/intended text here. 
--><!-- 
My original idea on seeing this additional dūtaka was that the statement was about issuing a replacement for a lost or damaged second plate, which would indicate that IN00087 is actually the second half of IN00088. However, there is also IN00089, where no such replacement seems to have taken place, but we do have a second dūtaka (the same guy) for halikākara. So in this light, the sentence seems to be evidence that IN00087 is after all from a different charter than IN00086, in spite of the seamless fit of the two.
