The maṅgala symbol is indiscernible in my facsimile. Fleet transcribes it as oṁ (not noting that it is a symbol); Sircar says it's siddham expressed by a symbol. It is definitely outside the margin, level with line 1.

The halanta M in l2 is unclear but seems to be a special character. Other halanta Ms in the inscription seem to be identical; the clearest on the rubbing are the ones at the end of v8 in l12 and at the very end of l13. It consists of a slightly reduced ma with a hook at the top left, with an extra stroke above it that is not a horizontal line, but a curve starting above the middle of the ma and ending at the right-hand side of it, near the bottom line. This extra stroke is thickened (like a comma) at the top left. Compare the similarly derived halanta Ts in l13 and l14, and the halanta N with a modern-looking halanta sign in l9.
-->
          <!--
The end-verse punctuation in l2 is likewise unclear but seems to be a double vertical.

For stutyo in l4, Fleet notes that originally he had read stutyai and the correction stutyo was recommended by Kielhorn (as well as reading amalāṁ instead of Fleet's original atulāṁ in l5). Apparently the o mātrā is not a double śiromātrā here, but one that consists partly of a regular ā mātrā, as in mohaḥ and vibhavo in l6 as well as several other instances later on.

Between pa and tya of opatyakām in l5, there is what seems to be an aborted character. It may be the t of tya, first started too close to pa, which would have left no space for the subscript ya to curve back up, so the engraver may have started the letter again further to the right.

Fleet prints rāhulākhyāś in l7 (as pointed out by Sircar); this is probably a typo.

-->
          <!--
Fleet prints yathā-bhāvataḥ; I follow Kielhorn _1891:190 in taking these as separate words. Kielhorn also wants to emend bhāvataḥ to kāriṇaḥ; I have not considered this thoroughly, but it seems unnecessary to me: we can take pravitatam in place of a finite verb (as Fleet seems to have done) and understand bandhor yathā bhāvataḥ to mean "with as much good disposition as toward a kinsman".

The halanta N in l9 seems to be composed of a regular n and a halanta sign below it; the sign much looks like a devanāgarī halanta sign; it also resembles the comma-like punctuation dashes of this inscription.

          <!--
In l12, both Fleet and Sircar read mvu (and correct to mbu). Since v is used for b throughout the inscription, this makes sense, but the subscript character in fact looks very b-ish.
-->
          <!--
The halanta T in l13 is not very clear but seems to be a complex special character like the halanta Ms above. It looks more or less like a ta with the end curving back and up (sort of like tra), with a little something added at the top left and a curving extra stroke from the top middle to the right bottom. The one in l14 is identical.

          <!--
The halanta M at the end of l13 is obviously triggered by the physical line end. It is preceded by some space (less than an average character's width) so that its right edge is flush with the margin.
-->
          <!--
At the end of v9 we again have both a comma-dash and a double vertical. Here the extra punctuation may be motivated by the boundary between the verse bit and the date.

        <p>samvaT <num value="269"><g type="numeral">200</g><g type="numeral">60</g> 9</num> caittra śu di <num value="7">7</num>||<g type="ornament"/><!--
I adopt Fleet's reading of the numerals. Sircar reads 268 for the year and 9 for the day. Fleet_1888:274-275n2 notes that a symbol similar to the last figure of the year occurs in the Bhumarā pillar (%IN00080 l9) and another similar one in the Khoh Charter of Saṁkṣobha (IN00081 l24). Fleet thinks the former is 9, but the latter and the one here stand for 7. He adds that the same figure occurs in lines 19 and 21 of the Nepal inscription of Jiṣṇugupta (IA 9 p172) which Bhagwanlal Indraji interpeted as 8 - but Fleet apparently disagrees with that too. The last figure of the year is a plain serifed vertical like a ra letter; the figure of the day looks like a vowel U or an elaborate ru. Ambiguity markup should probably be added.
--><!--
The closer sign, preceded by a double vertical, consists of a sign similar to a figure 8 (or a Gupta numeral 20), followed by five more verticals gradually diminishing in size, creating the effect of tapering out (along the centreline), and finally ending in a long horizontal dash.
