Since the inscription is on one face of a single plate, I do not include page breaks in the edition. 
--><!-- 
The characters are remarkably neat, but even more remarkable is the correctness of the text, which seems to be unique among Vākāṭaka plates. It is perhaps the only one that has amala, not āmala; certainly the only one I've seen that has samrājaḥ instead of samrāṬ. There are only three loci where the text needs emendation, and only one of those (avabhr̥ta in l5) is an actual "typo", while bhāgi and mūrddhnā (in l4) are more like dialectic forms. Is this perhaps a template from which actual grants were meant to be copied, rather than an unfinished grant? It is on unusually thin copper, yet unusually well preserved - maybe stored in a chancery hall for a long time? 
--><!-- 
The space at the beginning of l1 is clearly to leave room for dr̥ṣṭam. 
--><!-- 
The halanta T is small and deeply subscript (its bottom is aligne with the bottom of rā), but not simplified: it even has a boxhead. 
--><!-- 
The halanta M in l4 is reduced and subscript, but not as deep as the T in l1, and its form is simplified and seems to have no boxhead. 
--><!-- 
Mirashi notes that traces of the top portion of a letter can be seen after dauhitrasya at the end. On the facsimile I only see a thin mark that could be anything. According to Mirashi this shows that the engraver had started to inscribe "gautamīputrasya" which, he thinks, "could very well have been written in that space" (#Mirashi_1963:77), and this in turn means that the engraver "received an order to stop before he could complete the line". I find this unlikely, and in any case, fitting gautamīputrasya in the available space would have required a shoehorn.
