Fleet supplies "oṁ" at the beginning of the inscription. Given the size of the lacuna in other lines, it's reasonable to assume that there was either a maṅgala symbol or a brief invocation such as svasti at the beginning.

I'm not really comfortable with the restoration udaya-giri, since the same compound appears (almost certainly) in v2 and the repetition would not be nice.

I'm also a bit unhappy with grasta, though the reading is fairly clear. I have no better alternative, but the r of (gra) looks more like a crack than an incised line to me; the crack extends beyond the stem of (g) and continues below the line for several characters' length. Incidentally, part of the same crack makes sta look like stra. Furthermore, the top left of (g) is not square like other g-s around here; in fact it looks much like śa is nāśa further on in this line. Read śastracakro? Not very likely. (Mitra reads trasta-bhaktārtti [which is impossible] and reports Cunningham [personal communication] as reading "grastacakorte".) And by the way, do we really have arti here? (Attested in MW as equivalent to ārti, but apparently rare.) Or non-standard sandhi with elision of initial ā? (See l4 for a repetition of the same.)

The ending of paṁkajānām is again not quite satisfactory. Fleet prints ā as supplied, but I think I can see a faint ā mātrā to the right of na. The ma looks strange and very different from the next ma in ramaṇīya; it is, however, identical to ma in mahī in l3. Still, I'm not happy with the syntax: I'd expect to find a singular accusative somewhere to match ramaṇīyam (Fleet translates "creates the fresh beauty of the water-lilies", but this is very awkward). The problem remains even if we construe paṅkajānām with arti-hartā.

The halanta t is a reduced subscript form with a line above, and it is followed by a separate punctuation dash.

Fleet emends pradāna to pradhāna (translating "heroism ... specially characterised by truthfulness"), but I think this is unnecessary; pradāna is generosity as in %IN00001 (v7), and the singular ending of a 3-member dvandva would not be the greatest linguistic peculiarity of this text.

I'm unhappy with bhaṅgo. The interpretation abhaṅgo is convincing, but the character just doesn't look like ṅgo (and abhaṅga does not seem to be attested). The top part is not open on the right, as any decent ṅ ought to be: it's a closed square-approaching-triangle, similar to va and ca in this inscription. The bottom, on the other hand, looks more like ta than ga. Mitra reads bhavot, emending to 'bhavat. Apparently he takes the subscript ta as an insertion (but the inserted na in l1 was between characters, not directly below one). I'm tempted to read bhakto, or at least read bhavto and emend to bhakto. Though on second thoughts I can accept bhaṅgo, taking the vertical line at the right-hand side for a scratch (that is what it looks like in Fleet's rubbing). For more circumstantial evidence, there's Bakker's (2014:39) point that Yaśodharman's "sthāṇor anyattra yena" etc. (IN00094, l6) seems to be a retort to Mihirakula's boast.
--><!--
Mitra (1861:266-267n13) reads paśupati-para-dama for the lacuna, construing it as one who subdues enemies. He also quotes Cunningham (personal communication) as reading varadama and adds that the reading may be also baradeva, "the noble deva". Fleet (1888:162n6) observes that we need a verb that supplies the antithesis to abhaṅgo. He does not hazard a conjecture. Bhandarkar (1929:295n4) says the lacuna was "so taken by Fleet as to mean that he broke the power of one Paśupati; and he was followed by Kielhorn." I don't know where Fleet and Kielhorn wrote these (is "Fleet" an error for "Mitra" here?). Bhandarkar also adds his own(?) suggestion for the lacune: paśupatiṁ bheje. Sircar (1965:425n6) conjectures paśupatim arcayati. #Bakker_2014:38n105 agrees with Fleet's thought that we need an antithesis to abhaṅga, with which I agree provided that bhaṅgo is the correct reading (see note above). Bakker also notes that Sircar's conjecture is unmetrical and offers paśupatim avanataḥ instead. Based on Cunningham's photo, arcayati is all but impossible, and avanataḥ doesn't fit the traces well either. As pointed out by Bakker, there seem to be three akṣaras after ma, but I have two caveats: as far as I can see, ma is not at all certain (it could be va/ca/ma/ba/pa/dā in roughly this order of decreasing probability), while the last of the three characters may well be a punctuation dash instead of an akṣara (or, even more likely, a halanta consonant with a dash above?). Upanataḥ may perhaps be more appropriate than avanataḥ, but it doesn't fit the traces any better. I'm giving up for now.

Fleet reads nothing before vāstavyaḥ at the beginning of l6. I agree with Mitra that there seems to be a ra before it, though it could also be the right-hand vertical stroke of a more complex character. The obvious restoration would be pura, though what remains to the left of the tentative ra does not look like part of pu. The metre of the lacuna is only correct if both parvvata and pura are right (in which case the lost bit could also be ..., but three syllables would be too much for the available space). For a wild guess, how about parvvata-gopapura-vāstavyaḥ?

The halanta M is a simplified small subscript form. The punctuation stroke is partly above it, but seems to be separate.

Fleet emends vasatā to vasatāṁ. Given the lacunae, I find this unwarranted - perhaps OK if we could read pādānām instead of pādena at the end.
--><!--
The lacuna is 5 morae in length. Mihirakula would just fit in, if we could read/emend rājño mihirakula-pādānām, but this is not very likely.

Mitra reads padena at the beginning of l7, which is unmetrical.

The first part of line 7 is completely lost now, available only in Cunningham's rubbing. Line 7 is legible on the extant stone from nāmnā. To the left of this point the break slants upward. Of bhavati in v11 only the i mātrā is left; top serifs are visible after that, and recognisable bits of letters from citaṁ onward.

The punctuation bar after ca seems, as Fleet notes, to be just a space filler at the end of the line

Mitra reads mūrddhani and then nothing else before damukhyo. I believe his ddhani is what Fleet read as dhni ti, which seems much better.

At the end of line 8 I'd expect tiṣṭhatu instead of tiṣṭhati.

I dislike rame at the end. According to MW, rama "pleasing" is attested only ifc; as an independent word, it only means "lover, husband".
