L10. PBS reads the first name as sirimandāpakakassa. The correct reading is ṇḍa, not ndā (cf. koṇḍā in l11), and there is definitely no double ka. Incidentally, the name makes sense this way.
--><!--
L10. PBS reads kreri(ñca)kallassa. I prefer to read the first character as ku, though it definitely has what looks like an e mātrā. It is, however, fainter than the clear u mātrā. The third character does not in the least resemble the clear ñca in l15. It looks most like ṭha, but it could possibly be ba, dha or tha (in a decreasing order of likelihood) instead; it also seems to have a bit of a tail at the bottom left, which may be an ā mātrā (in which case the consonant is probably b, since dh and ṭh appear normally to wear their e mātrās at the top.

L11. PBS reads the first name as doṇithomassa. I don't think the third character can be tho; the wings at the top are part of the character and not a vowel mark. I assume it is a ṇ with the loop not copied by the bidri worker, in which case the subscript circle must be ṭh.
--><!--
L11. The ā of nāma is clear but malformed: it is an upward extension of the tail of the na rather than being attached to the boxhead.
--><lb break="no" n="12"/>-cātuvejjassa caruka-nimitte sāmilladevena A-hira<unclear>ṇ</unclear>ya<!--
L12. As noted by PBS, this sāmilladeva may well be identical to Svāmiladeva of the Hisse-Borala inscription and/or of the Thalner plates.
--><!--
L12. The right wing of ṇ in hiraṇya is missing, but it seems to be an attempt to copy a damaged ṇ, rather than n (as read by PBS).

L13. PBS reads balīvarddadi, emending to balīvarddaḥ. The i is short. The hook at the top of dda must be a repha combined with an ā mātrā, and I feel balivarddādi makes sense, though properly we'd still need to emend it to masculine.

L14. PBS emends sā at the end of l13 to so and reads nothing for the first two characters of l14. His editor proposes to read "sopari" in a note. The original plates were evidently damaged here; the iron copy is clear but malformed. What I read as pa is a simple U-shape, and what I read as ka begins like ka at the top, but has a wavy tail extending to the left below "pa". soparikaras may be a good restoration of this bit, but (assuming the iron copy is very close to being a facsimile) there would have been no room here for so many characters, and I have not seen soparikara in other Vākāṭaka grants. Could this be some garbled form of sakl̥ptas?
--><!--
L14. PBS emends to sarvva-bādhā-parihr̥taḥ, which seems plausible.
--><!--
L14. Note the very clear initial ai (which, incidentally, looks almost like a modern Kaṇṇaḍa ai, and also looks quite identical to ñc in this inscription).

          <!--
L14-15. PBS reads datti/r adattra, emending to dattir adattā (perhaps his intent was dattir dattā). At the end of l14, tti is possible but far from certain. The first character of l15 is definitely not ra; it looks like tra or bhra. The second seems to be da, with a horizontal extension to the right at the top. The next two characters are malformed but certainly don't look like ttra. (The first is a bit like ka, with a wavy tail to the left, pretty similar to the other malformed character at the beginning og l14; the second looks like ra without a boxhead.) The emendation dattir dattā may be close to the original intent, but PBS's reading is not sound. One thing that I could imagine is that the copper original had dattiḥ pradattā or dattiḥ pradattaḥ, followed by punctuation.
-->
          <p>tad eṣa sva-viṣaya-para-viṣaya-vāsibhis sañcaranta<!--
L15. PBS reads tad epasya viṣaya-pariviṣaya, emending to etasya (and leaving the rest untouched). The ṣ of eṣa does look rather like p, but I'm certain my reading is correct and it makes much better sense; eṣa (?=grāmaḥ) is the subject of the verbs in l17.

L17. PBS reads nothing for the first two characters of l17, though he does emend sva to svai at the end of l16. The reading/emendation svaireṇa is suggested in an editorial note to his text. While the word seems a bit strange in the context, I cannot conceive of any other reading that might fit the inscribed characters. (Read svarato instead of svaraṇa, and emend to sarvato? Unlikely, that sort of misspelling would be very unusual.)

L17. śca is malformed, missing the crossbar and resembling a large kha or E.

L18. aramādīkr̥tya is clear and must be original, not the bidri worker's mistake. Still, the intent must have been apramāṇīkr̥tya.
--><!--
L18. PBS reads pratartheta, emending to pravartheta, sic. The rthe is probably a typo (though the bottom does look a little like th); the t instead of v is indeed what the character looks like, but I believe it's a v missing its bottom side, which was probably there in the original but not copied by the bidri worker.

L19. For my vāṣanvā, PBS reads viṣacca and proposes, very tentatively, that it may be a corruption of viṣṇuvr̥ddha. I find both the reading and the interpretation attempt unlikely. If this is a gotra name, then perhaps vāsiṣṭha? The gotra of the donees was not specified above; in fact, there seems to be a single donee (cātuvvejjassa). And we'd expect niveditasya or an equivalent around here, not a gotra name.

L21. PBS for some reason prints ādiṣṭena instead of ndiṣṭena. He does read sa at the end of l20 and ndi is clear.
-->
          <!--
L21. PBS reads the name as bhamasvāmi. I think the first character is more likely va, and the ma is subscript with something above it, probably another m. The name vammasvāmi (from varmma) seems plausible.
-->
          <!--
L21. The sa at the end of the line is malformed. I think it may have been a punctuation mark in the original, rather than a letter.

L22. At the beginning of the line PBS reads sarvvañca, with his editor emending to savvacca (sic) in a note. There is no r, and the third character is definitely not ñca. I have no idea what it is, but since sa[+ṁ]vva seems like a plausible abbreviation whereas something like savvaccha does not, I'm inclined to believe it is a numeral instead of a letter. If the date is a regnal one, we expect no more than 10 or 20. The glyph in the plate does not look like either of these, but seeing it as 10 requires less imagination than seeing it as 20. Alternatively, with even more imagination, it have been copied from just a halanta T with some scratches around it.
--><!--
L22. For the (remaining) numbers I provisionally accept PBS's readings, but these are not without problems. 1) What he reads as a clear 5 does not look like any sign for 5 that I (or Indoskript) know of; the closest resemblance I can find is to the numeral 30. If it is indeed 30, then *either the preceding character is not a numeral and Devasena ruled for at least 30 years, *or the preceding character is a numeral of 100s magnitude, and the date is not regnal. The latter is less likely; the problematic character does not look like it could be a 100-class numeral. 2) What he reads as 8 looks identical to the letter pu. It does not really look like an 8, except that Ojha's Palaeography has a vākāṭaka figure 8 looking just like this. First published in 1918, the book can't be based on this plate. However, I can't find a 8 in any Vākāṭaka inscription that I have encoded. So the 8 seems a bit doubtful; alternatively, the character could be a 4 with the crossbar omitted. 3) PBS's editor remarks that the number of the day looks like 7 to him. I don't really understand how; I agree with PBS that it's most probably 1.
--><!--
L22. The sa of vāsa is clear but malformed. PBS understands vāsa to mean varṣā, which seems plausible.
--><!--
Lines 21 and 22 extend only about half the length of the plate, and are aligned to the left margin.
