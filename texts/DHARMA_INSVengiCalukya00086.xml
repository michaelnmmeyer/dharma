That dear Vijayāditya shines supreme.<note>Again, the syntax of the stanza is awkward, and the images are not very coherent. The sentence about Vijayāditya being a parable (<foreign>dharmopadeśa</foreign>) can be fitted into the whole by assuming that is is the thought of the people, but this is not explicitly indicated by anything. The syntactical role of the compound ending in <foreign>°aikadeśa</foreign> is not clear; I have assumed it to be a locative expressing a condition, but the passive causative participle <foreign>gamitam</foreign> would expect an instrumental expressing an agent here, as in the translation.</note></p>

The first image of course refers to Rāma’s Causeway, but it is not clear to me whether the poet speaks about the monkey army constructing that causeway from rocks (called mountains here), or to some episode I am not aware of in which the monkey constructed mountains. The second image is about Kailāsa as the home of Pārvatī (and, implicitly, Śiva), but the flowers seem to have been picked by Pārvatī elsewhere, then hung (as garlands?) on the trees.</note></p>

        <p>Up to stanza XIV, the text is identical to that of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00025.xml">Kākamrāṇu grant of Bhīma I</ref>, down to the level of some spelling idiosyncrasies, except that the opening stanza in praise of Bhīma is not present here. Our stanzas XX and XXII also appear there, describing Bhīma while here they describe Vijayāditya III. These two charters represent the earliest occurrences of a full king list among the Eastern Cālukya charters known to me, and the only instances of a fully versified king list. It cannot be ascertained whether this list was composed in the reign of Vijayāditya III or Bhīma I, since the present grant may well have been issued when Vijayāditya III was no longer active. At any rate, given the awkward (or incorrect) syntax in some of the stanzas not shared with the Kākamrāṇu grant (including much of the donee’s description), I suspect that the verse king list was composed by someone with a better command of Sanskrit, and the writer of the present grant simply adopted it from the official records.</p>
        <p n="25-26" rend="stanza">These two stanzas are not quite intelligible to me. The earlier editors Ramesh and Sampath may have interpreted it as I do, but all they say about them is that the donee’s ancestor Kumāramūrti <q>developed differences with his erstwhile lord mentioned as Toṇḍamān and Kāḍuveṭṭi</q> (<bibl>
            <ptr target="bib:Ramesh+Sampath1977-1978_01"></ptr>
            <citedRange>37-38</citedRange>
          </bibl>). The reason for the passage’s opacity is primarily the poor Sanskrit used by the composer; in addition, better knowledge of the context may help reconstruct what is being hinted at here. The plates also have some damage here, but the only real ambiguity as regards the received reading is whether or not an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is present at the beginning of line 40 (see the apparatus). I agree with RS that a <foreign>visarga</foreign> is needed here, and whether the emendation is to replace an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> or to correct an omission is of little import. Assuming that the name Kumāramūrti is in the nominative, stanza XXV should then mean that he was the lord of the entire country and not just of two villages. This seems unlikely, since the ancestor would not be named then, while his grandson would bear the name Kumāra (stanza XXIX). However, our composer has already (in stanza XVII) shown a cavalier attitude to active and passive construction. I therefore propose that the other nominative in the stanza, <foreign>nāyako</foreign>, is to be understood as the agent of the passive participle <foreign>lāḷitaḥ</foreign>, resulting in a coherent and plausible stanza. What happened next is, however, even more opaque. Stanza XXVI seems to mention two kings, one of Toṇḍamān (though <foreign>bhūpates toṇḍamāninaḥ</foreign> is a strange expression and may mean something else) and one called Kāḍuveṭṭi. These two may or may not be a single person and either, none or both may be identical to the local ruler introduced above. The phrase <foreign>ity uktvā</foreign> in stanza XXVII makes it clear that the speaker of at least the second half of stanza XXVI (with the finite verb <foreign>uddharāmi</foreign> in the first person) was the donee’s ancestor, and what he said resulted in his leaving the country where he had lived. The situation is all the more unfortunate because the verb is much the same as the earlier <foreign>uddhr̥tam</foreign>, but probably used in a different meaning among the wide choice of senses derivable from either <foreign>hr̥</foreign> or <foreign>dhr̥</foreign> with the prefix <foreign>ud</foreign>. It seems most likely that the whole of stanza XXVI is meant to be a direct quote, but if so, then we learn nothing about the occasion that prompted Kumāramūrti to say this. My understanding is that the two references to a king mean a single person. This ruler, I believe, offered recognition as an underlord (or the command of an army) to Kumāramūrti, who may have been already a military leader rather than a simple country Brahmin. This is implied by <foreign>bhūri-yaśo-dhanaḥ</foreign> in stanza XXV and by the fact that his descendant the donee was also a general. Assuming this is the case, the virtue on account of which Kumāramūrti was cherished (stanza XXV) may have been military success rather than a generic platitude. However, precisely because he had already been cherished by his local ruler, it is perhaps most likely that the present offer came from someone else. Kumāramūrti apparently refused the distinction, so <foreign>noddharāmi</foreign> in stanza XXVI is to be understood as “I will not take as my own.” The position of <foreign>bhūpates toṇḍamāninaḥ</foreign> in the sentence may imply that the grounds for Kumāramūrti’s rejection was the king’s Toṇḍamān lineage or territorial affiliation. (Or possibly, the Sanskrit word <foreign>mānin</foreign> is to be understood here, in the sense “[only] a pretender to Toṇḍai kingship”.) To complicate matters further, the phrase <foreign>māna-dhanānvitaḥ</foreign> in stanza XXVII suggests that Kumāramūrti departed in honour rather than fleeing from a king’s wrath. The account may simply be putting a good face on what had actually happened. But I could also imagine that this is a further implication of what I propose above: if Kumāramūrti was solicited by a rival of the local ruler or by a king aspiring for suzerainty over the region, and Kumāramūrti refused out of loyalty to his local ruler, then it makes sense that he would have to depart out of fear of the other ruler, yet receive honours from his former ruler.</p>
