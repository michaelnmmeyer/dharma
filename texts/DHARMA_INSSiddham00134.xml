Furui says the secondary seal also bears text, three characters in two lines, which he reads as above, vī allegedly clearly and dīṭṭa uncertainly. In my opinion the relief is more likely to be figural than text; Furui's vī seems to be a seated figure (the body of the v being the figure's hips and thighs, the headmark its chest, shoulders and upper arms; the ī mātrā its head or possibly its breasts), while his dīṭṭa looks to me like the petals of a lotus throne on which the figure sits.

Furui prints the date as clear. I am loath to contradict him, but I find it far from clear - it may be better on the original photo he worked from. From the photo printed in his article, I'd say the following. 1. sa is probably there at the beginning, but very unclear. 2. the character after sa may be mva. 3. This is followed by a clear character that does not look like any 10 I know, and quite different from the 10 later in this same line (as well as from the 10 in the date of the Ghaghrahati charter, IN00131). I'd be inclined to read this as 200, in which case we have a GE date, not a regnal one. 4. The next character is quite unclear but could plausibly be a "4" (similar but not identical to the Ghaghrahati 4, and almost identical to a Nepali 4 in Bühler's and Ojha's tables). 5. After this, vai is damaged but plausible, while śākha is perfectly clear, and di is quite clear too. 6. The figure after this is clearly 10, identical to the 10 in the Ghaghrahati charter, IN00131, and to a Nepali 10 in Bühler's and Ojha's tables. 7. The next figure is unclear; it may perhaps be a Nepali 7, but could also be a Gupta 5.
--><!--
As Furui observes, yājñiya in l4 is probably to be emended to yājñiyā.
--><!--
Furui considers the gap in l5 a deletion, which I accept with the caveat that it may simply be damage. It is, however, suspicious that these characters are completely gone except for their serifs, while everything else around them is well preserved.
--><!--
Furui understands phalka as a title (citing MW for the meaning 'one who has an expanded or extended body', which comes from a lexicon that glosses this word as visāritāṅga, and thus, says Furui, analogous in meaning to mahattara). He takes all 13 people from Umacandra onward to be phalkas, arguing that viṣayamahattaras are mentioned first, mahattaras afterward, and phalkas last, so they must have had a lower rank. But if all these 13 were phalkas, then I see no point in writing out the title no more and no less than twice - there should be just one phalka prefixed to the first name and preferably preceded by a plural nominative ending, or there should be thirteen phalkas. All in all, I'm more inclined to see phalka as part of a name, or at worst an honorific (like e.g. bhaṭa, but not a title on par with mahattara), and pertaining only to Umacandra and Śarvvakāla (or, equally likely, only to Śarvvadāsa and Dudhrāsara). The list is somewhere between a compound and a non-grammatical listing: the dual in l8 obviously applies only to Mahendra and Cittracandra, not to the long list before them, while the ādi in l10 pertains to each name in the first list (before Mahendra), the dual and the second list.
--><!--
I accept Furui's reading for the name Dudhrāsara, but the characters are unclear and may have been corrected. Could the correct reading be Rudrāpara? The first character doesn't really look like either du or ru (no other du in the plates; ru in l6 and l12); perhaps ḍa?

Furui translates prāk-pravr̥ttā maryyādā (l14) as "custom practiced in the east" - I'm pretty certain it should be translated "old-established custom".
--><!--
For vāpakṣetra in l14-15, see my note on l11 of the Faridpur charter of Dharmāditya, year 3 (IN00128). I am still uncertain about the interpretation, but still inclined to believe that tathā is used in the sense of "and". Furui transcribes tathā-vāpa and translates. "Such vāpas of (i.e. size of) land plots are sold..."
--><!--
As for akr̥ta-kalanā etc (l15), he translates "with only observation without calculation made." This makes good sense except for the gender agreement problem; it's certainly better than khaṇḍala-kr̥ta etc in l11 of IN00128. We'd need to emend to khaṇḍā akr̥ta [as suggested by Griffiths to Furui].
--><!--
In l16 Furui reads kr̥tābhilāṣyaḥ (and emends as adopted here; compare IN00128:14). Given that s and ṣ are basically indistinguishable, I think °ābhilāsyaḥ is a more likely error in place of kr̥tābhilāṣasya.
--><!--
In l17 I adopt Furui's reading of sāṅkalpā°, but perhaps the original is rather saṁṅkalpā.
--><!--
I'm not sure about krīyatām in l17; I follow Furui but note that only an (apparently short) i mātrā is clear; krī is very plausible, but kri would also be possible.
--><!--
In l17 Furui emends dīnārāsr̥dya to dīnārām āsr̥jya (sic, the intent must be dīnārān). I have no better idea.
--><!--
Furui notes that the first 6 characters of l18 may have been erased and overwritten. I see no indication of this, but the characters are much damaged here, and not only the first 6. I provisionally adopt Furui's reading; mine would be s(u)dha(n)a-(śrī)-#1#(?ya)laga(?r)(tt)(?e) (yathā-pradhānād)i-kuṭumvino. Of this, yathā-pradhānādi seems better than sapradhānādi, and it also gives us a locative (Furui finds one in "Pasadhanakagdhaṅga").
--><!--
For °bhivyañcitaka in l18, Furui suggets the emendation °bhivyañjitaka, translating "(divided it) by manifested procedure", whatever that may mean. I recognise nothing of these two characters in the photo and find the reading very dubious.
--><!--
There may be another character between krameṇa and tad in l18; it's probably e if it's anything.
--><!--
In l19 Furui reads -kr̥taṁ vibhāgam, taking vibhāgam as the subject of the sentence, "a part (of land) with four borders fixed". I do not see the anusvāra and find this interpretation tenuous; catus-sīmā-kr̥ta-vibhāgam seems to make better sense. Admittedly, we then don't have a subject, which was either omitted or meant to be understood; we'd expect kṣettra-kulya-vāpa-dvayam on analogy with similar plates.
--><!--
At the very end of l19 Furui reads an unclear thā (giving vibhāgam athāsmābhir). I see only a smudge after ma, and find the sentence better without an atha. (Although the nte of śrūyante at the end of l27 is just as faint and just as much out on the fringe.)
--><!--
In this list again I follow Furui in putting spaces after proper case endings and hyphens after stem forms - but obviously we again have a loosely grammatical structure in which words are meant more like nominatives, though they are suffixed with ādi. (Cf. the varying ending mi/mī.) Also, I believe svāmino in l23 should be emended to svāminau: we wouldn't expect a genitive here, but a dual nominative makes sense.
--><!--
Furui interprets deyaka and candrikā as toponyms, which would be surprising since no such places have been mentioned. I'm more inclined to understand deyaka as "the thing which is to be donated", though I have no idea about candrikā. Furui counts the quarters on p96, and comes to three quarters in total (two quarters and two half-quarters), proposing that the final quarter is to be shared by the last 7 (or more) brāhmaṇas - which makes sense, and which also shows that these are quarters and half-quarters of the plot, not of separate villages.

Furui translates the bit with upari-likhitaka in l25 as "by above-written and future sāmantas and kings"; I'd rather take it as "future sāmantas and kings of the above-written [territory]".
--><!--
I would also emend na at the end of l25 to nā, giving ākṣepa, and replace Furui's translation "in agreement on preservation and dismissal of land donation" with "[who have understood śāstra and dharma] regarding the preservation of the donation of land and the endorsement of its seizure".

Furui transcribes an unclear ca at the beginning of l31. There is something there, but there is something at the end of l30 too; either could be a remnant of ca, and I feel the one in l30 is better positioned (not outside the margin).

Furui prints bhijāyante as clear, but the character is blurred and seems rather too narrow for bh; given that a version of this verse says hi jāyante, maybe that is what we have here too.

Furui prints sragdhā in l34 as clear; the first character could be mu or a couple of other things instead, while the second looks more like grā to me.
--><!--
The last character, as Furui notes, seems to be a numeral 4, very similar to the one in l1. Could this mean that 4 borders have been accounted for? Or is this a special version of an EOF marker?
