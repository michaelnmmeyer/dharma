daba siddham : This inscription has spaces (for punctuation) at least in the verses near the end. My facsimile is terrible, so I have not used it, but the spaces should be shown on the basis of a decent image.

daba siddham :Dikshit reads āyuktakaḥ. His editor (Dikshit_1929-30:65n5) notes that the plate "correctly" gives āyuktakā and thus there would have been several āyuktakas. Agrawala opts to read āyuktaka and cites (without specific reference) Sircar as reading āyuktakā and proposing several āyuktakas. I do not know if Sircar was the editor of EI in 1931 or if he says so in SI. I personally feel āyuktaka is not likely; there is certainly something after the ka, which may be an ā mātrā or the upper dot of a visarga (while the lower dot could be what looks like the thick end of the right arm of ka). The text has many superfluous visargas so the reading is not unlikely.

amwb : the expression "adhiṣṭhānādhikaraṇa" can be found in Damodarpur plate #1 l.4, Damodarpur plate #2 l.4, Damodarpur #4, l.3-4, Damodarpur #5 in the seal and l.4, and finally in "A grant of land to monasteries at Śiṣīpuñja, Madhyamasṛgālikā and Grāmakūṭagohālī" BC55, l.1.
I reported below the different translations suggested for this expression :
Damodarpur plate #1 l.4 :	"adhiṣṭhāṇādhikaraṇañ ca nagaraśreṣṭhidhṛtipāla" => translated by Bhandarkar1981_01 "the Board of the town presiding over the Nagara- śreṣṭhin Dhṛtipāla"
Damodarpur plate #2 l.4 : "adhiṣṭhānā(dhika)ra(ṇañ ca) nagara(śre)ṣṭhidhṛtipāla" => translated by Bhandarkar1981_01 "the Board of the Town, presiding over the Nagara-śreshṭhin Dhṛtipāla"
Damodarpur plate #4 l.3-4 : adhiṣṭhānādhikaraṇa[ṃ] nagaraśreṣṭhiribhupāla => translated by Bhandarkar1981_01 "the court of the district town as the chief of the nagara-śreṣṭhī Ribhupāla
Damodarpur plate #5 seal : koṭivarṣādhiṣṭhānādhi(karaṇa)sya => translated by Basak1919-1920_01 "Of the office of the adhiṣṭhāna (capital) of Koṭivarsha"
Damodarpur plate #5  l.4  adhiṣṭhānādhikaraṇa[?m] āryyya(na)gara(śreṣṭhi)ri(bhu)pāla => translated by Basak1919-1920_01 "the affairs of the town (adhiṣṭhāna) in the company of the nagara-śrēshṭhin, Āryya Ribhupala"
BC55 l.1  : Adh[i]ṣṭhānādh[i](ka)raṇañ => translated by you "the council of the capital"
For this expression, Apte suggests "Municipal Board" with the following references EI XV p.143, XVII, p.193, XX, p.61. In my opinion, the translation allows to find an equivalent or to give a base to understand what is behind this expression, but it refers to a system coming from the Roman antiquity. For this reason, I think this translation does not fit. Maybe the kind of questioning about the translation adopted for recurring terms that seem to be codified vocabulary belongs to the "controlled vocabulary" work in opentheso? In any case, it would be necessary to establish some kind of mapping of these words in order to decide on a stable equivalent for them.
In french, one could translate by "conseil communal" to remove the reference of Roman antiquity, but the equivalent words in english seem to be "town -city - village- local"
Consequently I consider your translation "the city council" fits well and suggest changing the translation of BC55. As you translated nagaraśreṣṭhin by the city’s guild-president, it seems to me necessary to change one of the two "city" by "town" in order to render the distinction made in sanskrit between "adhiṣṭhāna" and "nagara". My feeling is that adhiṣṭhāna is a city somewhat more important than a nagara ? according to the site "wordreference" a "city" is larger than a "town". Consequently I suggest conserving "city council" for "adhiṣṭhānādhikaraṇa" and replace the translation of "nagaraśreṣṭhin" by "the town's guild-president"

amwb : I checked in Bakker's World of the SP . He does not comment the meaning of the word in particular and translates āryanagara-śreṣṭhin by "venerable mayor" :
see the translation of a part of Damodarpur Plate #5 p.242 and its note 688 p.242 :
"On 5 Bhādra in the year 224—when the Paramadaivata, Paramabhaṭṭāraka, Mahārājādhirāja, the illustrious ...gupta was reigning over the earth, and when in the Koṭivarṣa District—thriving thanks to the government of Devabhaṭṭāraka Mahārājaputra, commanding the infantry, cavalry and elephants, who had been elected by that venerable (king) to the position of viceroy in the province of Pundravardhana—(when thus in the Koṭivarśa District) the prefect Svayambhudeva, who had been appointed in this (office) by that (viceroy), was leading the administration of the capital together with the venerable mayor ...pāla, the merchant Sthāṇudatta, the chief artisan Matidatta, and the first secretary Skandapāla—a request was made by a man of good family hailing from Ayodhyā, Amṛtadeva

p.243 : he comments this passage : " On the local level, on the other hand, in the eponymous district capital Koṭivarṣa itself, power remained in the hands of the Pāla clan, which held the office of nagaraśreṣṭhin (mayor) for about one century. The administration of the town also remained remarkably stable. In addition to the mayor, its three-headed governing board consisted during one century of a distinguished merchant (sārthavāha), artisan (kulika) and administrator (kāyastha). The latter office remained in the Pāla family, which clan also produced the nagaraśreṣṭhins for a hundred years, whereas in the representation of the merchants and artisans we see a gradual shift from the
Mitras to the Dattas.

amwb : I share your opinion about the translation of "nagaraśreṣṭhin", what you suggested is closer to the text. It seems perhaps a little more audacious to translate by "mayor" when there are so few occurrences. On the other hand, I am wondering about the translation of Ārya as a name of a person. According to the arguments developed below, I suggest translating the expression "āryyanagaraśreṣṭhi" by  "the guild president of the city called "Ārrya".
Argument 1 : in Damodarpur plates, when there is the expression nagaraśreṣṭhin the name of the nagaraśreṣṭhin is placed after and not before
Argument 2 : in BC55 Ārya is the name of a village. In this same plate one can also find the expression Adh[i]ṣṭhānādh[i](ka)raṇañ. If we observe the compound in BC55 l.1-2 "(ṣa)ṇḍ(ika-)vīth[e]yā[r](y)ya(-g)r[āma-]-prāveśya", we can deduce that the name of the village preceded the word "grama".
Then when we observe the composition of the different compounds with the expression "nagaraśreṣṭhi", we can deduce that the name of the nagaraśreṣṭhi is placed after :
Damodarpur plate #1 l.4 :	"nagaraśreṣṭhidhṛtipāla" Dhṛtipāla, the nagaraśreṣṭhi
Damodarpur plate #2 l.4 : "nagara(śre)ṣṭhidhṛtipāla" Dhṛtipāla, the nagaraśreṣṭhi
Damodarpur plate #4 l.3-4 :  "nagaraśreṣṭhiribhupāla" Ribhupāla, the nagaraśreṣṭhi
Damodarpur #5 l.4 "āryyya(na)gara(śreṣṭhi)ri(bhu)pāla" : Ribhupāla, the nagaraśreṣṭhi
For this last example, we have the word āryyya placed in the beginning of the compound. I doubt the relevance of the translation of Basak1919-1920_01 "in the company of the nagara-śrēshṭhin, Āryya Ribhupala" and would suggest for this example " Ribhupala, the guild-president of the city (called) Āryya"
Argument 3 : Ārya as a name seems to me somewhat dubious because generally a name is a compound and named someone by the word Ārya is quite unexpected?
Another possibility would be to consider āryya as an adjective and the translation would be "the venerable, respectable or respected guild president of the city"
-->greet the peasant householders, beginning with the notables — the most eminent among them being the Brahmins<!--
amwb : here as elsewhere I suggest the trasnlation "consisting chiefly of brahmins" cf my arguments in BC39 line 2, BC49 line 2, BC51 line 6, BC57 line 2, BC54 line 1. See MW p.178 col1 et Apte p.408 n°8...voir consisting chiefly of Brahmins Apte p.1174

amwb : I am wondering why you use plural "the disciples and grand-disciples".

amwb : maybe it would be useful for the reader to add the note made in BC55 on the term prāveśya : The term X-<foreign>prāveśya</foreign>-Y in cadastral contexts indicates that Y is part of the larger unit X. See the glossary in Schmiedchen forthcoming.
According to this note and in order to make the text more clear for someone who will not read the sanskrit text in paralell, I would translate the long compound as follows
