Pargiter does not edit the seal inscription, noting only that just a few characters are legible, but what remains is consistent with the seal of %IN00130. There are facsimiles of the seals in IA39 (next ot p208), but my scan is poor, so even for %IN00130 I cannot be sure where the line break is. I can see dhi near the end of the first line, but I cannot tell if there is a ka next to it or just some noise. In the second line only sya is discernible; raṇa can be seen with some imagination; there is probably no ka here. (Compare the Dvādaśāditya plate, IN00134, where ka is very clearly in the second line)

The opening mangala symbol is indiscernible in my digital copy of the facsimile in IA39; it may be in or before the line. Pargiter transcribes it as oṁ, Sircar as siddham.
-->
          <!--
For bhāśaitya in l5, Pargiter notes that the reading is sic (and speculates on the meaning on #Pargiter_1910:197n54); alternatively, perhaps it could be bhāśvaitya; there seems to be something below the ś.
-->
          <!--
For a/ānimittra in l6, Pargiter suggests the emendation anamitra - this seems overzealous and overconfident.
-->
          <!--
For kālasakha in l6-7, Sircar tentatively suggests the emendation kālasukha - what's wrong with kālasakha?
-->
          <!--
For arjjuna-bappa in l7, Pargiter believes this to be one name (meaning father of Arjuna), while Sircar emphatically says these are two names.

For the problematic bit in l9, Pargiter reads adhikr̥tyasmābhir akātyer and emends to adhikr̥tyāsmābhir ekātmye. Sircar reads adhikr̥tyasmābhir akātye and emends to adhikr̥tyāsmābhir aikātmye. My facsimile is poor; I see no superscript r.
--><!--
For the last character in l9, Sircar suggets ja in addition to Pargiter's suggestion na.
--><!--
For samudra in l10, compare the Dvādaśāditya plate (IN00134:14) which has prāk-pravr̥ttā maryyādā, much more sensible. A good facsimile of this plate should be checked for this.
--><!--
In l11, Pargiter prints tathā-vāpa. Sircar notes that vāpakṣetra means cultivated field as opposed to aprahata or khila. I believe āvāpa-kṣetra would also be possible. I certainly disagree with Pargiter's hyphen.
--><!--
For khaṇḍala-kr̥ta, also compare IN00134:15, which clearly has khaṇḍam akr̥ta, which makes sense except for a grammatical problem. This should also be checked in a facsimile.
--><!--
In l12 Pargiter emends dr̥ṣṭi to dr̥ṣṭa; Sircar reads dr̥sṭi and emends to dr̥ṣṭi.
--><!--
In l12 Pargiter emends to vikrayamānikā; Sircar emends to vikrīyamāṇakāḥ (also emending to ṇ in the same word in l11).
--><!--
In l13 Pargiter reads aṁttra, emending to attra; Sircar just reads attra, noting Pargiter's reading. The rubbing is unclear; there does seem to be a dot above ma..

In l13-14 Pargiter reads nyāsādho and tentatively emends to nyāsādheḥ. Sircar reads nyāsādhā (this is more likely from the facsimile) and tentatively suggests nyāsanaḥ or nyāsanāt as the intended word. But compare IN00134:16, adhigamyāsya sādho[+ḥ] - this is obviously what was intended here.
--><!--
In l14-15, Pargiter suggests the emended reading kriyayādhr̥tya, noting that the last two letters are illegible. Sircar shows yādhr̥ as merely unclear and prefers to emend to yathā saṁkalpitaṁ tathā kriyatām ity avadhr̥te, which seems rather heavy-handed. Again, compare IN00134:17 where there is a much more sensible text.
--><!--
In l15 Sircar reads vatabhogana, emending to vātabhogena. The facsimile is unclear; I believe Pargiter that the vowels are actually there.
--><!--
At the end of l15, the last three letters are illegible except for an e mātrā according to Pargiter, whose restoration I accept (along with Sircar who prints it as merely unclear).
--><!--
For nalenām in l16, Pargiter guesses that a letter has been omitted and tentatively restores nalenāṁśam. Sircar, who already has the benefit of parallel texts, suggests nalenāpaviñchya or possibly nalābhyām apaviñchya. In fact the m may be a hiatus filler: compare mudaka in l20 and possibly *manya in l21 - this would give us nalenā (correct to a) + m + apa.
--><!--
In l16 Sircar prints the superscirpt r supplied by Pargiter as if it were there in the plate. There is no trace of it on the rubbing, but then, the i mātrā of the vollowing vi is also invisible there.
--><!--
Neither Pargiter, nor Sircar note the large space in l17, which may be the result of some deleted text. The space begins where ñchya in l16 hangs down considerably to this line, but extends for about 3 times the width of this character.
--><!--
In l18-19 Pargiter reads sāgottra, emending to sagottra. Sircar just reads sagottra, noting Pargiter's reading. No ā mātrā is visible in the rubbing.

In l19 Pargiter suggests likhitakāgama. Sircar would prefer likhitakam āgāmi. I agree with āgāmi, but I'm not sure about Sircar's other emendation. He wants -likhitakam to qualify bhūmidānam in l22, which seems logical. Nonetheless, my intuition is that the text is not so logical; instead, uparilikhitaka may mean "the above [region]" and be in compound to the governors; or it may be an unnecessary piece of technical jargon, copied from a template where governors were mentioned earlier on.
--><!--
For l19-20, Sircar emends to rājaiḥ ... śāstrair; I keep Pargiter's partial emendations.
--><!--
In l21, Pargiter emends samya to samyag; Sircar accepts his emendation. But see next note on anai.
--><!--
For anai in l22, Pargiter emends to anaiḥ and notes that this seems to be an irregular plural instrumental form of idam. Sircar, however, emends to anyaiḥ, which seems much better. In fact, I would go further, and emend samya in the previous line to *manya, which would stand for anya (compare the use of m as a hiatus filler in l20, mudaka, and probably in l16, mapaviñchya). This may be a bit wild, but to me it seems consistent with the logic of this inscription, and "samyag dattāny api" just makes no sense, while "anya-dattāny api" would fit the context perfectly.

In l24-25, Pargiter notes that the first character of nāvātā may also be bhā. He wants to read nā probably because he (and Hoernle) want to interpret nau+ātā+kṣeṇī as a shipbuilding yard (because ātā means doorframe [but not a ship's frame!] and kṣayaṇa means harbour [but not a shipyard, and not kṣeṇī]), see #Pargiter_1910:198n67. I find the interpretation forced, especially given the difficulty of reading nā. Sircar adopts Pargiter's reading and interpretation, but notes that nāvātā and kṣeṇī may be geographical names - this (or a single longer name) is what I think most likely.
