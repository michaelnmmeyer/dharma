              The text follows the edition of H. Krishna Sastri in <bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:KrishnaSastri1925_01"/>
            <citedRange unit="page">21</citedRange>
            <citedRange unit="item">58</citedRange>
          </bibl> in absence of a picture.
              Following the entry in A. R. No. 471 of 1893 <!-- @target has to be added --> Krishna Sastri edited the text which was written on two faces on a stone slab as one entry with continuous line numbering although the two faces evidently display two distinct inscriptions. They are given here as 58a and 58b respectively. 
              The term <foreign>rūpu</foreign> probably refers to a carving that depicts <foreign>Candrarāśibhaṭāra</foreign>. However, mention of such a picture is neither made in A. R. <!-- has to be adjusted to the @target --> nor in <bibl>
            <ptr target="bib:KrishnaSastri1925_01"/>
          </bibl>.
              The spelling <foreign>śrāpiñci</foreign> (line 2-3) is a mistake for <foreign>śāpiñci</foreign>. Besides 'to curse' <foreign>śāpiñcu </foreign> can also mean 'to accuse' (e. g. <bibl>
            <ptr target="bib:Sītārāmācāryulu1922_01"/>
            <citedRange unit="page">752, 754</citedRange>
          </bibl> '<foreign>tiṭṭu</foreign>' which also means '<foreign>niṁdiṁcu</foreign>' (<bibl>
            <ptr target="bib:Reḍḍi1989_01"/>
            <citedRange unit="page">381</citedRange>
          </bibl>)). 
               <!-- It may be noted, however, that śrāpaṁ (శ్రాపం) is found in a google search even today, albeit seldom, and that this form can also sometimes be met with in Hindi. It is a hypersanscritism to the early existence of which this inscription furnishes evidence. Therefore, the spelling, albeit etymologically incorrect, has to be accepted as correct in the form of a loanword in Telugu.  -->
              The verb <foreign>koṇu</foreign> means 'to take' in most instances but also the meanings 'to prick, peirce, strike down' are attested. The expression <foreign>caccina</foreign> 'died' is remarkable since this intransitive verb is not the standard for denoting death in a battle. 
              Hence, one <hi rend="italic">could</hi> surmise that he died a natural death (long) after his successful revenge.
