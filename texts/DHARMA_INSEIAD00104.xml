            <note>The reading seems certain enough and should be treated as one of several very minor spelling mistakes from the point of view of classical Sanskrit. The integrity of the meter is not affected by short <foreign>i</foreign> in this word, which probably allowed it to persist through the production process of the text into the final inscription.</note>

            <note>An ending <foreign>-o</foreign> would constitute incorrect sandhi. We therefore prefer to consider <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">rājña śrī-</foreign> as either a simplified spelling for the correct sandhi <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">rājñaś śrī-</foreign>, avoiding the three-part conjunct <foreign>śśr</foreign>, or as a phonetic simplification.</note>

While this is possible, we consider a Middle Indo-Aryan source of the confusion equally likely since intervocalic Old Indo-Aryan <seg type="phonetic">t</seg> and <seg type="phonetic">d</seg> had begun to merge into <seg type="phonetic">ð</seg> well before the time of our inscription.</note>

            <note>After inspection of the original stone there can be no doubt that this reading is correct. This rules out the interpretation of <bibl><ptr target="bib:Skilling2011"/>: <citedRange>9, n. 5</citedRange></bibl>, based on the reading <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">kuleddhva<unclear>j</unclear>ena</foreign>, in terms of a learned compound with inflected prior member (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">aluksamāsa</foreign>). We propose a tentative alternative interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">śakkyakuloddhvajena</foreign> as <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">śakkyakulo<supplied reason="lost">r</supplied>ddhvajena</foreign> “scion of the Śākya family,” with omitted <foreign>r</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">-ūrddhva-</foreign>, either as accidental Prakritism (note <foreign xml:lang="pra-Latn">śakkya-</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">śākya-</foreign> in the same word) or as intentional “imprecise spelling” in the Sanskrit-Prakrit grey area that was meant to bring the word in question closer to the instances of <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">-ddhvaja-</foreign> “banner” in this stanza and create a punning relationship (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">śleṣa</foreign>) with them. A meaning “later” for <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">ūrdhva</foreign> is well-attested, making the interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">ūrdhvaja</foreign> as ‘born later, scion’ at least possible. The dictionaries do not appear to list this meaning for the compound, but MW, s.v. “being higher, upper” and PTSD, s.v. <foreign xml:lang="pli-Latn">uddhaja</foreign> “upright, honest … (v.l. for <foreign xml:lang="pli-Latn">pannadhaja</foreign>)” at least show the possible semantic breadth of the compound. A third, less involved, interpretation, would be to take <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">śakkyakulo</foreign> simply as prior member of a compound with <foreign>-o</foreign> instead of <foreign>-a</foreign>, but while such compound spellings are well-attested in Gāndhārī (e.g., <foreign>acaliobhava-</foreign>, cf. <bibl><ptr target="bib:Baums2009"/>: <citedRange>236</citedRange></bibl>), we have no reason to expect them in our inscription.</note>

            <rdg source="bib:Munirathnam2005">sa dharmmajena</rdg>
            <note>Both editors later corrected themselves to <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">sadharmmajena</foreign>. It would indeed be hard to construe independent <foreign>sa</foreign>, presumably as nominative singular masculine of the demonstrative pronoun, in the sentence in question. The problem would be not only that the referent <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">darppadhvajo yo</foreign> is already picked up by <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">taṁ</foreign> — see 8 <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">imena tena</foreign> for another case of pleonastic pronouns — but that the two pronouns in question here would be far apart from each other and disagree in their apparent gender and/or case (neuter nominative or masculine/neuter accusative <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">taṁ</foreign> vs. masculine nominative <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">sa</foreign>). Reading <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">sadharmmajena</foreign>, one is immediately tempted to understand <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">sa(d)dharmmajena</foreign>, “born from the excellent Dharma.” But this is complicated by the constraints of the meter which requires the first syllable of the word to be short. The composer may thus have intentionally resorted to the “imprecise” orthography with <foreign>dha</foreign>, since this commonly stands for <foreign>ddha</foreign> in the corpus of Prakrit inscriptions (see, e.g., <foreign xml:lang="pra-Latn">supabudha-</foreign> in EIAD <ref target="DHARMA_INSEIAD00019.xml">19</ref>, l. 1, below p. + 9). The only possible alternative is to interpret <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">sa-</foreign> as “together with” and translate “this wheel born together with the Dharma,” the solution also adopted by von <bibl><ptr target="bib:Hinüber2013b"/>: <citedRange>366</citedRange></bibl>. The intended meaning would then be that the Dharma and its symbol the wheel originated at the same time when the Dharma was fist promulgated (the <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">dharmacakrapravartana</foreign>).</note>

We think we can offer a significant improvement in the interpretation of the imagery expressed by this word. <bibl><ptr target="bib:Skilling2011"/>: <citedRange>8</citedRange></bibl> translated the entire phrase <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyāśarīrāraṇisaṁmbhavena tenottamadhyānaguṇendhanena jñāṇārcciṣā</foreign> as “by the spark which is insight, (the spark) that arose from the kindling wood which is his magic (illusory?) body, by this fire wood which is virtue, the deepest meditation.” They go on to suggest that the term <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyāśarīra</foreign>, which they concede to be unattested elsewhere, might either be a general reference to the insubstantial nature of the Buddha’s physical body or even refer directly to the buddhological concept of the <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">nirmāṇakāya</foreign>. There is a syntactic problem with their interpretation in that <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyāśarīrāraṇisaṁmbhavena</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">tenottamadhyānaguṇendhanena</foreign> are both very likely to be attributes of <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">jñāṇārcciṣā</foreign>, not only because of their position preceding <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">jñāṇārcciṣā</foreign> but also because in the real world the production of fire required both firesticks and fuel. A less problematic interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyāśarīrāraṇi-</foreign> suggests itself if we simply take <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyā</foreign> to be the name of the Buddha’s physical mother Māyā and remember that <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">araṇi</foreign> “(lower) firestick” is a common metaphorical expression for a mother with reference to the process of sexual intercourse and conception (MW, s.v.). The overall phrase would then amount to a perfectly balanced comparison of the Buddha’s knowledge (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">jñāna</foreign>) as arising from the physical condition of his birth from his mother Māyā’s body (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyāśarīra</foreign>) and the further condition of his highest meditative absorption (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">uttamadhyāna</foreign>), with a flame (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">arcis</foreign>) arising from the combination of fiestick (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">araṇi</foreign>) and fuel (<foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">indhana</foreign>). The mention of the Buddha’s mother Māyā in stanza 4 further provides a link with the specification of his further ancestry as the Śākya family in stanza 2, neatly bracketing the three Triṣṭubh stanzas describing the Buddha and his accomplishments. The archeological context of the pillar would have contributed to bringing the Buddha’s mother to the mind of a learned reader of this inscription since the pillar appears to have been established in proximity to a majestic <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">toraṇa</foreign> in the decorative program of which the birth of Śākyamuni features prominently. We cannot entirely rule out that a learned double entendre was intended by the composer of the verse by using the compound <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">māyāśarīra</foreign>. We know that the docetic buddhology set forth, for instance, in the <hi rend="italic">Lokānuvartanāsūtra</hi>, was current among the Śaila schools of Āndhradeśa, at least by the time of Candrakīrti (ca. 600–650), but possibly earlier. At the moment, however, we do not know which monastic lineage(s) were present in Phanigiri. In the absence of any supporting evidence from the site that would suggest that religious figures such as Dhammasena might have been familiar with such docetic trends, we consider it preferable to adopt the simpler interpretation of this compound.</note>

Presumably <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">-dharisaṁ</foreign> would somehow be derived from the root <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">dhr̥ </foreign> “to hold,” but in fact it is the pillar that holds the <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">cakra</foreign> rather than vice versa. On closer inspection of the original stone, however, it seems clear to us that the second akṣara is <foreign>°e</foreign> rather than <foreign>dha</foreign>. This suggests an interpretation as two words, the second of which corresponds to Old Indo-Aryan <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">īdr̥śa</foreign> “such a one,” i.e., a <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">cakra</foreign> exactly as just described in the four Sanskrit stanzas. Middle Indo-Aryan forms of this word with r are common (cf. CDIAL, s.v. īdr̥ śa), but in light of the general closeness of the Ikṣvāku Prakrit inscriptions to Pali it is interesting to note that the normal Pali form is <foreign xml:lang="pli-Latn">edisa</foreign> with <foreign>d</foreign>.</note>

This, however, is perhaps again due to the metre.</quote> We may add as a third problem, not addressed by <bibl>
                <ptr target="bib:Skilling2011"/>
              </bibl>, that the place or institutional recipient of the donation would not be mentioned. It seems to us that all of these problems can be solved by dividing words as we do and assuming vowel sandhi in <foreign xml:lang="pra-Latn">mahāsenapatisarame</foreign> (= <foreign xml:lang="pra-Latn">mahāsenapatisa arame</foreign>) which then specifies the institutional recipient of the donation as the pleasure-grove of the Great General. The title <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">mahāsenāpati</foreign> figures very prominently in the Ikṣvāku inscriptions from Nagarjunakonda where it is applied to members of the royal house. This in turn makes it possible to interpret <foreign xml:lang="pra-Latn">naṁdiṁṇakasa</foreign> as the name of the heretofore nameless physician, who was then the donor of both the <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">cakra</foreign> and, secondarily, the pillar on which the <foreign xml:lang="san-Latn">cakra</foreign> was mounted (as indeed specifid in stanza 1). Following the usual pattern in the Ikṣvāku corpus, his Indo-Aryan name Nandi is extended by a suffi <foreign xml:lang="pra-Latn">-innaka-</foreign>.</note>
