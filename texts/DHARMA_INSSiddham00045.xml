Though not noted so by either Bhandarkar or Agrawala (but observed by Lielukhine on his website), the beginning of this stanza looks unmetrical to me: there is syncopation from the second to the third foot. *jayativi:bhuścatu:rabhujaś would be metrically fine and may have been the way the author pronounced it.

The end of this line is broken away; part of the top and part of the subscript ya are visible of the character read here as vya. Hall reads nya and reconstructs nyayādi. Fleet follows, so does Agrawala. Bhandarkar suggests nyayaika instead. His editor (Gai? see Bhandarkar_1981:340n4) remarks that the upper part of the consonant seems to be v rather than n, as v is of an angular shape throughout the inscription, while nya in line 8 is quite different. Thus Gai (or whoever) suggests the restoration vyapāya. I find his arguments for vya convincing, but the lost akṣaras could have been any of those proposed above; my personal preference is for vyayaika. There is no visible punctuation sign at the end, though there is a small space.

          <l n="ab">śate pañca-ṣaṣṭy-adhike varṣāṇāṁ bhūpatau ca budhagupte<!-- 
Again there is syncopation here (again observed only by Lielukhine), from the first to the second foot. Also, the first foot is not supposed to be . = ., so even assuming a pronunciation like *pañaca would not save the metre.

Prinsep read trayodaśyāṁ, which is unmetrical. The first syllable is damaged; Bhandarkar feels it is "very distinctly" dvā. It is quite unclear on the facsimile, but dvā is plausible; śuklaikādaśyāṁ would also be possible, though the caesura would be obscured by saṁdhi in that case. This means that arguments hinging on this weekday for calculating the Gupta epoch need a pinch of salt. With my photos: ukla is in fact illegible and restored: only the left edge of ś remains, the stone is worn smooth after that. dvā is very unclear but very likely at the beginning of l2; da is completely illegible.

The punctuation sign at the end of the stanza is a horizontal dash; there may be dots above and below it.

In l5, both Bhandarkar and Agrawala print pitur gu° rather than rggu. The facsimile is quite illegible here, but the height of the letter seems to confirm this. Moreover, there seem to be two characters between ṇā (which is quite clear) and kāriṇo (which is again quite clear). 
--><!-- 
At the end of l9, Bhandarkar prints a daṇḍa as unclear; Agrawala shows it as clear and superfluous. I see neither a clear visarga, nor a clear punctuation mark, only a large, mostly vertical smudge after ta. 
--><!-- 
The horizontal punctuation mark at the end of l8 is longer than the (similarly superfluous) mark in the middle of l8. It may have been used here as a space filler..
