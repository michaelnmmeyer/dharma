n="01"/><g type="mangala"/><!--
The mangala sign, which Bhandarkar transcribes as "oṁ," is to the left of the margin and perhaps slightly above the first line. It is very unclear on my facsimile but seems to resemble a figure 8. Sircar calls it a symbol "for siddhaṁ later pronounced as oṁ siddhiḥ or siddhir astu".

Lielukhine reports that Sastri (1931?) read the place as nūpuravāsakāt. Actually, nū is possible (there is a similar nū in the Kahaum inscr), but then we'd have to read the na of skandhāvārāna as a halanta n, for which there is no indication.
--><!--
Bhandarkar suggets reading °ucchettu as °ucchettā, and also emends all the following genitives to nominative - I say just accept the text as it is; there's been plenty of discussion of the conflict of these genitives with the nominative in L4.

Lielukhine had tāvi(rguṇya) as his guess for the toponym. I follow Bhandarkar but all I see is (vāvi#ri#ṣya). Bhandarkar seems to have seen a plain ri here [not a subscript r], since he transcribes the name as Vāvirikshyara in his translation.

Ghosh reads the second viṣaya as Krimilā; Bhandarkar says estampages don't support this, but Krivilā is "practically the same thing as" Krimilā
--><!--
Note that on the basis of the Gaya plate, the dual is not because there is one koṣa officer for each village, but because there is a pair: a brāhmaṇapuroga and a grāmavalatkoṣa?

Bhandarkar has evañ cāha without any indication of uncertainty, but the thing after va looks like cā, not ñcā to me. Lielukhine has eva[#ṁ] and there's definitely a dot over the va, though it may or may not be an anusvāra. Lielukhine (probably citing Sircar) also suggests emending to evaṁ cārtho vidito. This seems unnecessarily to me, but if emending, then perhaps less invasive to emend to etaṁ cārthaṁ viditaṁ, a credible if incorrect construction. For the next bit, I think it could be viditamvo as easily as viditambo.
--><!--
There is a dot like an anusvāra above the ta of viditam, but Ghosh_1939-40:53n1 says this is a hole due to damage.

Bhandarkar reads ca (printing it as clearly legible) before ttraividyasya at the beginning of l8; there may or may not be a character there, but it seems unnecessary and is not read by Ghosh, nor by Agrawala.
--><!--
For śrottravyam, previous editors read śrottavyam (which may be a simple mistake under the influence of karttavyā), but I think the character is more likely to be ttra, and this is a credible hypersanskritisation.
--><!--
Bhandarkar prints kartavyā, but the text is clearly karttavyā.
--><!--
Bhandarkar reads grā[+ma]pratyāye(na), but (na) is out of the question. Lielukhine has pratya[+yā]meya. I believe the correct reading is pratyāyāmeyā, though the diacritics on the two yā-s bend to the left rather than to the right.
--><!--
grā[+ma] should perhaps be marked up as an abbreviation rather than as omitted character? Probably not, abbreviation in a compound would be funny.
--><!--
Lielukhine reads na cetaf for na caitāf, which seems to make more sense; the characters, however, doo look like caitāf so I've added this as an emendation. Sircar emends to caitat.

For my anyathā Bhandarkar and Agrawala read nānyathā, but a full vowel A fits what is visible of the inscription, is phonologically correct, and matches the Gaya version which has manyathā, obviously a misreading of Anyathā. Ghosh in fact does read (a)nyath(ā).
--><lb
n="10"/><unclear>sy</unclear>ād iti<g type="closer"/><!--
L10. iti is followed by some sort of damaged punctuation sign (a figure 6 rotated 90 degrees clockwise?), then 3 short horizontal strokes, then a space of about 5 akṣaras. I'm marking up the sign combination as a closer glyph; space marked as part of the date paragraph.

Bhandarkar actually reads anyagrām° at the beginning, but even his editor adds a footnote (p227n22) that "the reading seems to be anu" and it does. It is, however, clearly anya in the Gaya plate - but is that any better? And why should we prefer the testimony of a forged document which seems to have a number of copying errors? Maybe anu+grāmam indeclinable, in compound, the chief notary (akṣapaṭalādhikr̥ta) in charge of each and every (anu-) village? Sounds to me more plausible than "officer of another village" (Sharma, Names in Gupta Inscriptions) or "of Anyagrāma" (Bhandarkar).

Bhandarkar prints [#dūtaḥ kumā] as a single supplied bit. In fact we have, before the clear ra, a single smudged character that may be ma (or any number of other things), preceded by a larger blotch 2-3 characters in extent, which seems a bit small to cover "dūtaḥ ku". So while kumāra sounds plausible, I have very strong doubts about dūtaḥ.
