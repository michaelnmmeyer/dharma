The one after that (ta/ṭa) is just a trace, could be ṭa, not ta, perhaps dha or ba.The next one is imo definitely not ṅka; could be ssa or kṣa. Then kuladāma seems plausible, though it looks more like dī and sa is possible instead of ma. Sanyal also reads a va at the very end of the line, which I cannot see.

daba siddham : The "mo" of paścimottara looks rather like ṇa. Compare l11 of IN00026 (Damodarpur plate 1) where the reading is paścinattar° emended to paścimottar° - that could be the same case. In l7 of the present inscription, mo looks the same, so this is not a "typo" here. 
--><!-- 
daba siddham : For the damaged bit near the end of l21, Sircar reads (?sadyaḥkhāta); Sanyal: (ā)dyakhāta; Agrawala: (ṣvā)dyakhāta. The first unclear character is imo completely unrecognisable; dy may or may not have a vowel mātrā above it; the next unclear character looks to me quite different from khā just a few characters onward in this line; after that, ta seems to have something below it (tsa? tma?) and the subscript thing also seems to be connected to pa, unless it's ma or something else (though parikhā makes good sense). I could also imagine ādyapathaḥ (or [°ddeśe]ṇādyapathaḥ, as in l23 below. In this case the visarga seems to be a later insertion, wedged below (tha) and the following pa and slightly below the regular placement.

daba siddham : The halanta T of saṁvvat is again linked at the top to the previous character. 
--><!-- 
daba siddham : Sircar and Agrawala read the date as 120. But N. B. Sanyal in Sen_1942:xii.n says it is 121, and Sanyal_1955-56 reiterates 121. Sircar_1943a:26n says he is aware of the faint scratches Sanyal sees as "1" but these are much further away from 20 than 20 is from 100 and thus they cannot be a third numeral. Sanyal_1955-56:66n3 insists that "The sign is distinct in the original" (to which he had access, while Sircar worked from inked impressions alone), while Sanyal's editor (ibid.) says "The reading 20 1 seems be [sic] supported neither by the original nor by the impressions" But this needs checking in hardcopy; my digital versions are badly scanned at the critical point and the note may not in fact say "20 1" but something else, and may have the missing "to" after seems. In my opinion the sign does look quite distinct, but I agree completely with Sircar that if it were a 1 rather than an accidental scratch, it would be much closer to the 20. The character above the place where the 1 should be (tāṁ of mahimatāṁ) does extend down to this line, but there would have been plenty of space below it to fit in a horizontal dash. I should also add that this line is much longer than the 1 after vaiśākha at the end of this line and the 2-s above in this plate, which again implies that it's an accidental scratch.

				The incipit of this plate is almost identical to the one of <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00034.xml">Jagadispur Charter of the Time of Kumāragupta I</ref>. Nevertheless we can notice that here the officer is called Acyutadāsa and that here there is no mention to the fact that his authority depends on the emperor. As the localisation of these two plates is the same and as their dates are relatively close, one can ask if the two officers, called in one plate Acyutadāsa and in the other Acyuta, are the same person. If so, it is interesting to observe the loss of the name ending -<foreign>dāsa</foreign>.

            <foreign>hastiśīrṣe</foreign>
          </supplied>, i.e. in Vibhītakā,<note>
					As the previous translations of this inscription show it, there are several possibilities to interpret <foreign>hastiśīrṣe</foreign>. The translation of <bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Sircar1943_02"/>
            </bibl> is somewhat unclear. Indeed, in his translation of the line 1, he reads <foreign>hastiśīrṣavibhītakyāṁ</foreign> and translates <q>residing in Hastiśīrṣavibhītakī</q>. In line 20, his translation of <foreign>hastiśīrṣa-vibhītakyāṁ</foreign> by <q>Hastiśīrṣavibhītakī</q> might be supported by the singular locative. But in lines 23-24, the text compells him to consider Hastiśīrṣa an independant place name. At the end of his translation, he adds a note and criticizes the understanding of the place names suggested by Sanyal : <quote>It will be seen from the note that Sanyal has failed to decipher many important passages of the record including several geographical names. His suggestion regarding the two villages Hastiśīrṣa and Vibhītakī is not supported by the passage <foreign>hastiśīrṣa-vibhītakyāṁ</foreign> of the text.</quote> 
Indeed <bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Sanyal1955-1956_01"/>
              <citedRange unit="page">58-9</citedRange>
            </bibl> doesn't follow <bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Sircar1943_02"/>
            </bibl>'s understanding and he considers Hastiśīrṣa and Vibhītakī two different names of village. 
					To clarify the problem, I give below the three contexts where the word <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> appears in the text : 
					<list rend="numbered">
              <item>in association with the place name Vibhītakī, but not in compound: <foreign>hastiśīrṣe vibhītakyāṁ</foreign>, line 1</item>
              <item>in association and in compound with the place name Vibhītakī: <foreign>hastiśīrṣavibhītakyāṁ</foreign>, line 20</item>

						The first interpretation could be to understand a place name 'Hastiśīrṣa' as <bibl>
              <ptr target="bib:Sanyal1955-1956_01"/>
            </bibl> did. A second possibility is to see <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> as a compound indicating a large aera. This interpretation is based on my previous observation according to which the geographical indication is presented from the larger to the smaller entity. So it could be possible to consider <foreign>śīrṣa</foreign>- a word used in a geographical manner to indicate that some place is near another larger place and <foreign>hasti</foreign>- a name of place like Hastināpura? If so, the translation could be <q>in the upper part of Hasti</q>, <q>collateral of Hasti</q>, <q>close or next to Hasti</q>. A third possibility could be to consider <foreign>hastiśīrṣa</foreign> a compound composed by the derivated word of the constellation name Hasta followed by <foreign>śīrṣa</foreign>, like in the compound <foreign>mārgaśīrṣa</foreign><q>the month under the constellation of Mr̥ga</q><supplied reason="explanation">i.e. november-september</supplied> which is recorded in <ref>

            </ref> and by several inscriptions (for example: <ref target="http://siddham.uk/inscription/in00090">Betul Charter of Samksobha, year 199</ref>, line 3)<!-- amwb : I also found mārgaśīrṣa in in the Kesaribedā Donation of Arthapati line 13 (siddham IN1003) and in Kauvatal Charter of Sudevarāja line 24 -->.
