The name vr̥ṣṇivr̥ddha in l2-3 must, as editors note, be a mistake for viṣṇuvr̥ddha which is consistent in other Vākāṭaka inscriptions and is also the form attested in standard gotra lists (#Mirashi_1963:93). The i of ṣṇi is not at all clear in the facsimile.
--><!--
In l5 Mirashi reads vākāṭakānāṁ followed by a superfluous punctuation mark. I see no anusvāra, and the mark is too low down in my opinion to be punctuation, so I believe it's a damaged halanta M. Sircar in SI agrees.

Do we want to mark up the language change, maybe with @lang added to p?

Mirashi reads the name at the end of l5 as nāndīkaḍa. Deshpande & Mahajan (DM) read nāndikaṭa. Sircar prints nāndīkaḍa, but talks about nāndīkaṭa in his footnote. I think ī is certain, and ḍ is unlikely; ṭ is not very likely either; I'd read it as c on account of its similarity to c in acārasiddhika in l22, though it looks more like v than c.
--><!--
At the beginning of l6, DM and Sircar read bhākā, Mirashi reads tākā. I think bh is a bit more likely, but e.g. the t of majjātā in l19 is very similar too.
--><!--
DM, Sircar and Mirashi agree on lakkhoppakābbhāse (except that Sircar has ppā instead of ppa, but this is probably a typo), so I retain the reading. The kh of kkho could be something else, but nothing Prakritish (e.g. ktro). The ā of kā is not visible in the facsimile. Bbhā does not look very convincing: the upper part looks like p (though the b of bala in l8 is not much different), and the lower part like d. Still, taken together, bbhā (or bbha) is probably the best guess. (Or could this be something corrected to dde, to give us °oddese? But o attached to the preceding k is even less likely than a.)
--><!--
Sircar prints ākāśa in l6, but this must be a typo.
--><!--
DM read paṭṭesu in l6; I believe Sircar's and Mirashi's paddesu is more likely.
--><!--
Mirashi prints ihābhuttike instead of ihāmuttike in l9; this is definitely a typo.
--><!--
The superfluous punctuation character in l10 (as well as all other editorially deleted punctuation characters unless otherwise noted) is a small vertical, bulging to the left like an opening bracket, below the baseline. Some of the others look more like a mirrored J or even an U. Also, though I delete these marks for standardisation, they are clearly not random but mark the items of a list.
--><!--
Mirashi prints an anusvāra after bhālandāyaṇa-sagottesi in l10. I do not see it, nor do DM or Sircar read it.
--><!--
I accept Mirashi's reading of jivujjesi in l10. DM read situjjesi, Sircar follows. The first character could be just about anything from the facsimile and it probably, but not certainly, has an i mātrā. The second character could be a number of things with u (tu looks more likely in fact than vu), but it could also be ka or A/Ā.
--><!--
Mirashi again reads an anusvāra after the first sagottesi in l11, noting that it "is very faint, but it is there". Sircar and DM do not read this. I see a definite dot to the _left_ of the i mātrā (practically above tte) which may or may not be what Mirashi saw as an anusvāra.
--><!--
Like Mirashi and Sircar, I mark up the ka of kosika in l16 as unclear. The intent is clearly ka, but the shape is strange; possibly tu was inscribed first, then corrected to ka by inverting the hook, but the character still has no right arm, perhaps not added because the following sa is very close.
--><!--
For deAjjesi in l12, DM and Sircar read desujjesi. I believe Mirashi must be right, deajjesi sounds more plausible. Compare the uncertain jivujjesi in l10, which in my opinion may also be X-Ajjesi.
--><!--
The punctuation mark after deAjjesi is actually below the si, not after it, though there is some space. The punctuation mark of the following sagottesi is likewise under the si.
--><!--
I think veṇhujjesi in l12 may in fact be viṇhujjesi. There is a dot above the apparent ve, which together with the apparent e mātrā may be remnants of an i mātrā. (Though cf. vaṇhu in l30, where there is definitely no i mātrā.)
--><!--
Mirashi emends paḍehi in l15 to paṭehi. DM actually read paṭehi.
--><!--
Only Mirashi reads the numeral 1 in l18. DM read nothing here, while Sircar reads a punctuation mark. Since all other punctuation marks so far have been quite different (this one is a short dash at midline-height), Mirashi must be right in seeing it as a numeral, which also makes very good sense.
--><!--
caUttho in l18 is our first instance of aü/aï diaeresis in the corpus. I just use the capital U to show that this is a full vowel, but perhaps ü should be used to reduce ambiguity?

For saṁvviṇayika in l20, DM read saṁvvaineyika, while Sircar has saṁvviṇeyika. Neither seems correct from the facsimile; I follow Mirashi's reading.
--><!--
For keṇṇa in l20, Sircar reads (kle)ṇṇa, which seems unwarranted.
--><!--
The word kkhataka in l20 seems clear in the facsimile. DM and Mirashi read kkhanaka, while Sircar has khātaka (sic). While kkhanaka would be expected, the character in question is ta, not na. Sircar's omission of the initial k is probably a typo; I see nothing like an ā mātrā here. (Unless, perhaps, Sircar read the k, of which only the right arm is visible, as an ā mātrā? But then the rest of the letter doesn't really make a kh.)
--><!--
Mirashi notes that the i of ggahaṇi in l21 may have been deleted. It is certainly damaged.
--><!--
DM and Sircar read pārampara in l21; I follow Mirashi in reading parampara as there doesn't seem to be an ā mātrā.
--><!--
DM and Sircar read avāra in l22; I accept Mirashi's acāra which seems more likely next to the bit about acammaṅgālaka. The character does look more like v than c.
--><!--
I accept Mirashi's and Sircar's khaṭṭā in l22, though I see no ā mātrā (unless the next character is cā instead of co). DM read khaṭṭa.
--><!--
Mirashi prints acammaṅgālika in l22; the li is probably a typo.
--><!--
The punctuation sign after sopanidhi is a double vertical; otherwise it is like the others: small and below baseline.
--><!--
Sircar reads kutuppānta in l23; this may be a typo.
--><!--
The punctuation sign after mahākaraṇa in l24 is also below the last letter of the word.

For śāsaṇa-vādam pamāṇaṁ in l25, DM read śāsana cādamyamāṇa. Mirashi expresses indebtedness for his reading to B. Ch. Chabra.
--><!--
For bu in l26, DM and Mirashi read (or at least print) vu, which seems unlikely. Sircar reads bu, noting that perhaps tu or vā was intended. For another thought, this may be a or ā corrected to vā. Perhaps the scribe began to engrave ābādhaṁ, then realised that he missed a letter?
--><!--
For the next word, DM, Mirashi and Sircar all read ābādhaṁ, with Sircar alone marking the ā as unclear. The character looks like sa (with the right limb atrophied): there is no hook whatsoever. There is, however, a little curve way below the character, atop the te of likhitehi in the next line, which may be the bottom of the hook of ā, so I accept the reading.
--><!--
As Mirashi notes, tissa in l27 is probably meant to be tassa.
--><!--
Mirashi in CII prints brāhmaṇehiṁ in l27. bāmha is clear, so his brāhma may be a typo. I see no anusvāra (of which he also prints one with likhitehi).
--><!--
For pari(ñña)pite in l27, DM read parikūpite. Sircar has pariñapita, while Mirashi gives parikupite, emending to "parikupitehi veditassa" which is imaginative but a bit wild. I am quite certain the solution is pariññapite.
--></p>
        <p><!--
Sircar reads the number in l29 as 5. Mirashi's and DM's 4 seems more likely, though the symbol is not identical to the one used for foliation.
--><!--
In l29 DM read samupāṇatthi. Sircar reads samuhāṇṇatthi, to mean sva-mukhājñapta, noting that the reading is not beyond doubt. There is definitely no double ṇṇ, only a single ṇ; Sircar's ṇṇ may be a typo. Mirashi reads samupāsatthi and translates "given by Us personally"; I am not sure how he arrives at that (unless he translates Sircar's reading instead of his own). Mirashi is the only one to note that we have correction here; he believes that the last three akṣaras of his samupāsatthi "are incised over others which have been cancelled." I see no recognisable trace of correction in tthi, while after it there is a pretty clear śā that none of the previous editors note. I am far from sure, but I prefer Sircar's version. I don't know if tthi is plausible; I'd expect tti. In fact, now that I think about it, the character may be tthi corrected to tti. Also, perhaps it is not sva-mukhājñapta but sa-mukhājñapti, a CP accompanied by oral orders?
--><!--
The pa of seṇāpatiṇā in l29 may be a correction from va or sa. DM and Sircar read seṇa; I believe Mirashi is right in readin ṇā.
--><!--
The punctuation symbols transcribed as double daṇḍas in l30 are long double verticals, like modern double daṇḍas.
--><!--
The ornamental glyph in l30 is a four-petalled flower. The closer is a horizontal dash.
