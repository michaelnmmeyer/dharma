                <p>Halantas. Final M looks rather like a check mark, at head height. Final T looks like a slightly reduced ta, possibly with a different stroke in place of its headmark (l18, l34), or clearly without a headmark in line 34. Final N is a slightly simplified na without a headmark (l26). Rare final Ḷ in l28-29 (3 times) and l37. All instances of the latter are unclear; those in l28-29 seem like regular ḷa with a curved horizontal stroke attached to the head, while that in l37 appears to be a reduced ḷa with a curved vertical stroke in place of a headmark.</p>
                <p>Original punctuation marks, if present in the inscription, may be plain vertical bars and perhaps a median dot. See the apparatus to lines 14, 19, 28 and 33 for potential punctuation marks.</p>
                <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally on top of the character to which it belongs, but occasionally apparently atop the next character ((l19 muṁjuṇūru, possibly l37 °āśaṁ for °āṁśa).

              <handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00053_hand1">The primary hand inscribing most of the text. Tends to be rather bold, using fairly simple and slightly cursive glyph forms.</handNote>
              <handNote xml:id="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00053_hand2">I cannot assert definitively that this is a different hand, but line 37 certainly includes a higher number of awkward characters than the rest of the text. In addition, the dependent vowel <foreign>i</foreign> may be formed differently here than elsewhere, and most importantly, the consonants <foreign>b</foreign> and especially <foreign>y</foreign> are drawn rather differently. My impression is that this is a less confident hand, which attempts to draw sophisticated characters with a varying degree of success, unlike the primary hand that simplifies boldly and confidently.</handNote>

The second character may have been corrected from something else.

              <note>I feel quite sure that all of this sequence describes the petitioner, so the words are technically in compound (in fact simply being used without case endings). See my translation and commentary about how my interpetation differs from that of Hultzsch here. Hultzsch's <foreign>nama</foreign> may be a typo in the edition, since the <foreign>ā</foreign> is the clearest part of the character <foreign>nā</foreign>; his emendation concerns the locus as a whole, not this particular character. In the facsimile, I see nothing of Hultzsch's <foreign>ṇa</foreign>. The damaged space is slightly wider than expected for <foreign>ṇa</foreign>, but I assume that Hultzsch read this character correctly. If so, this genitive ending, though syntactically incorrect here, is nonetheless in my opinion an indication that I am correct to interpret all of this stretch as a description of the petitioner.</note>

The second looks to me like <foreign>jñā</foreign> with the vowel <foreign>ā</foreign> attached twice, once to the middle prong and curling over the top as occasionally done with <foreign>j</foreign>, and a second time in the standard way, attached to the top right. It is also possible that Hultzsch is correct in interpreting the curled upper part (which I see as the first <foreign>ā</foreign>) as <foreign>l</foreign>, but in that case the subscript component seems to me to be too large and complex for <foreign>v</foreign>, looking more like a consonant+<foreign>r</foreign> combination.</note>

He further assumes that the pronoun <foreign>eteṣām</foreign>, “these”, implies that the Brahmins in question would have been assembled in the king’s presence when he made the grant. I have no opinion pro or contra, except that the required emendation is a major one (not the rectification of a scribal error), and that is the assumption that the donees were assembled is correct, this gathering would probably have taken place at the village in question and not in the king’s presence. I wonder if the donees were in fact listed on an additional plate that is now lost.</note></p>

          </bibl> believes otherwise and thinks <foreign>grāma-grāma</foreign> is deliberately used, meaning perhaps a large village or a chief village. He points out a parallel in line 18 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00004.xml">Peṇukapaṟu grant of Jayasiṁha I</ref> (where, however, the original editor of that grant, Fleet, deems the repetition to be dittography).</p>
        <p>By my interpretation of the rather ellpitical and vague passage in lines 26-29, the Eastern Cālukya king Indravarman is hereby issuing a grant at the request of (or endorsing a grant made by) a petty ruler likewise named Indravarman, the son of Koṇḍivarman/Roṇḍivarman. The four <foreign>boḷ</foreign>s listed here were probably persons of note in the territory concerned, which was ruled by the petty Indravarman as a vassal of the Cālukya Indravarman, and were therefore (<foreign>evam</foreign> in the text) given the task of conveying the grant to the village and publicising it. It is also conceivable that they were, in the first place, the messengers sent by the vassal Indravarman to the suzerain Indravarman’s court to ask for this grant to be made or endorsed. Hultzsch, however, interprets the passage differently. He believes that the subordinate who petitioned for the grant was Koṇḍivarman, and the Indravarman mentioned in this passage was the son of the Cālukya Indravarman, who was appointed as the executor of the grant at the request of Koṇḍivarman. As for the four <foreign>boḷ</foreign>s, according to Hultzsch they were probably witnesses to the grant, which he sees as being implied by the word <foreign>evam</foreign>, “thus”, in the text. I find his interpretation unconvincing for the following reasons. 1) it requires two emendations (<foreign>nāma-dheya</foreign> to <foreign>nāma-dheyo</foreign> and <foreign>°ājñaptir</foreign> to <foreign>°ājñaptiḥ|</foreign>) , whereas my proposal only assumes a lack of sandhi at a point where the writer may well have preferred hiatus for the sake of clarity. 2) even with Hultzsch’s emendations, the resulting syntax is extremely awkward and staggered, with the possessive phrase <foreign>koṇḍivarmmaṇo … vijñāpanayā</foreign> split into two widely separated parts, containing another possessive phrase in the intervening text, whereas the text as I read it involves only the minimal awkwardness of a long and not-quite-regular compound. 3) I perceive my own scenario as quite coherent, while I do not see such coherence in Hultzsch’s scenario. Why would the vassal have requested that the suzerain’s son be appointed as executor? Why is the text not clearer if the vassal actually made two requests, one for the grant to be made, and another for the prince to be appointed as executor? Why would witnesses need to be involved at all, and—since I am not aware of witnesses being named in any Eastern Cālukya grant—why is their function and the reason for their inclusion not clearly stated? 4) I believe that the reason why Hultzsch did not choose to interpret the text along lines similar to my thinking was the fact that by my interpretation, both the vassal and the suzerain bear the style <foreign>mahārāja</foreign>, whereas by his understanding, only the suzerain gets this style. Since <foreign>mahārāja</foreign> is often used as a title of subordinate rulers, I see no difficulty in understanding this to refer to the vassal Koṇḍivarman here; and conversely, Eastern Cālukya grants frequently use <foreign>mahārāja</foreign> (as well as even more unassuming styles) for their kings without any implication of inferior status.</p>
        <p>The meaning and purpose of the last line is obscure. It may have been added subsequently, since it comes after the closing sign at the end of line 36 and it seems to be in a different hand. If I am correct in reading the word <foreign>ājñā</foreign> in line 37, then it may be that the executors were also granted shares in the donated land, and if so, Coḍa-boḷ may have been another agent instrumental to the implementation of the grant.</p>
