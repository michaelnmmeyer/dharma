                    <p>Original punctuation marks are vertical bars with small serifs. MN transliterates the opening symbol as oṁ.</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally at or above head height to the right of the character to which it belongs. Dependent au is not conspicuously different from o, but its humps tend to be asymmetrical (see line 56 for some specimens, not very clear). Final M may be represented in line 63 by a dot with a straight downward tail; or this may be an anusvāra and a scratch. Upadhmānīya in line 67 looks like ṟa.

        <note>The invocatory stanza was probably a <foreign>gīti</foreign>, possibly a different member of the <foreign>āryā</foreign> family. I cannot reconstruct a meaningful and metrical reading. MN shows <foreign>divyojva</foreign> and <foreign>ṭā</foreign> in round parentheses, which elsewhere he uses for emendation. But in the present case I see no reason why he would have wanted to emend the preceding syllables to these strings; also, the number of <foreign>akṣara</foreign>s in this line would be very small compared to adjacent lines if the parenthetical text were not present on the plate. Scribal errors may well be present in addition to misreading and misprinting. The composer's intent probably included the words <foreign>jaṭā</foreign> and <foreign>karāñjali</foreign>, and I would expect also to see <foreign>yatra</foreign> or some other relative pronoun. See the translation for an attempt at interpretation.</note>

I accept that MN could make out <foreign>y</foreign> more clearly, in the original.

        <note>Much of the sequence <foreign>mūrjapāyāM</foreign> is probably a correction written over something else. I read <foreign>mū</foreign> in accordance with secondary literature citing this name as Ūrjapā, assuming that the <foreign>u</foreign> marker is entirely below the body of <foreign>m</foreign>, and the hook that changes it to <foreign>ū</foreign> is at baseline to the right of the body. This character seems to have been changed from <foreign>ra</foreign>, and there would have been no room to insert a regular-shaped <foreign>ū</foreign> between this character and the next. Nonetheless, MN's reading <foreign>mu</foreign> is also definitely possible, as is plain <foreign>ma</foreign>. The next one appears to have been <foreign>ja</foreign> even before correction. No <foreign>repha</foreign> is discernible in the estampage, but on MN's statement I accept that one is present; the faint vertical line above and to the right of the <foreign>j</foreign>'s initial circle may be a vestige of that. The following <foreign>pa</foreign> also seems to be pre-correction, but the barely distinct <foreign>ā</foreign> marker, if it is one, is probably a subsequent addition. The final <foreign>y</foreign> is, however, heavily corrected. The ending may be <foreign>yāḥ</foreign> instead of <foreign>yāM</foreign> (see also the note on <foreign>sutāyāṁ</foreign> above), but does not seem to be simply <foreign>yāṁ</foreign>. The string <foreign>varam</foreign> is probably not a neuter accusative but a masculine nominative with an epenthetic <foreign>m</foreign> to avoid hiatus with the following <foreign>ū</foreign>; see also the apparatus to <foreign>-kṣama-m</foreign> in line 39 and <foreign>deha-m</foreign> in line 40.</note>

The sequence is hard to make sense of, but I think <foreign>kṣama-m</foreign> is probably non-standard sandhi for <foreign>kṣama</foreign> (epenthetic <foreign>m</foreign> inserted to avoid hiatus); scribal error for <foreign>kṣama Āśrito</foreign> is also a possibility. The string <foreign>āśritovat</foreign> was perhaps intended to be <foreign>āśritoddhr̥t</foreign>, one who uplifts.

        <note>The <foreign>m</foreign> in MN's reading was presumably meant to be <foreign>ṁ</foreign>; it is shown in round parentheses, which may mean that it is supplied rather than unclear. His <foreign>ihor</foreign> must have been intended for <foreign>ihoru</foreign>. As indicated in my markup, much of the last line is unclear, and this applies in particular to any character components below the baseline. Nonetheless, I am certain that MN's <foreign>sya</foreign> must be read as <foreign>sva</foreign>. Reading <foreign>ihoru</foreign> and <foreign>ivoru</foreign> both seem possible, and both are fairly appropriate in the context. The problematic character does resemble the one in <foreign>deham</foreign>, but but is narrower and does not have a distinct tail like the <foreign>h</foreign> of the latter. The final <foreign>r</foreign> may be indicated by the squiggliness of the lower outline of the <foreign>i</foreign> marker on the next character, or it may be absent and need to be supplied; see also the next note. I am far from certain of my reading and restoration as a whole, much less of my understanding of the text. Nonetheless, if an epenthetic <foreign>m</foreign> is assumed (as perhaps twice in line 39, see the notes above), then <foreign>dharmmaḥ svayaṁ deha-m ivoru-kīrttir</foreign> (for <foreign>deha Ivoru-</foreign>) is intelligible and fits the context.</note>

        <note>The whole lacuna should be about the same length as the last line on 4r (the back side of this line), i.e. roughly 14 characters. Parallel loci (emended and restored) are <foreign>-senāpati-yuvarājādy-aṣṭādaśa-tīrtthādhyakṣam ittham ājñāpayati</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00039.xml">Māṁgallu grant of Dānārṇava</ref>, and <foreign>-senāpati-yuvarāja-dauvārikādhyakṣam ittham ājñāpayati</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00049.xml">Raṇastipūṇḍi grant of Vimalāditya</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00052.xml">Andhra Sahitya Parishad plates of Śaktivarman</ref>. I restore <foreign>yuvarāja</foreign> with some confidence, since it is common to all three parallels, and the circular stroke at the edge of the crack makes <foreign>y</foreign> likely. However, all three parallels have this phrase after the words <foreign>rāṣṭrakūṭa-pramukhān kuṭuṁbinas samāhūya</foreign>, while in the present grant that phrase comes subsequently, so <foreign>ājñāpayati</foreign> is unlikely here. The lost text may perhaps have been <foreign>yuvarāja-dauvārikādhyakṣān samāhūya</foreign>.</note>

Here, “fillet” must correspond to <foreign>bandha</foreign>, which is not very convincing. “Tents” are an intriguing idea, but I am not certain if <foreign>vistāraka</foreign> can mean a tent pole.

<div type="commentary">
<p rend="stanza" n="16">MN summarises this stanza to mean <q>Dānārṇava was the eldest son of king Br̥had-Bhīma, or Chalukya Bhīma II by his first wife. […] He was a descendant of the great king Kali Viṣṇu; his mother was Urjapāya (sic!) who was a daughter of the king of Kaliṅga. He assumed the second name Bhīma when he ascended the throne.</q> The editor of JAHRS remarks in a footnote that the idea about the second name Bhīma is <q>extremely doubtful</q>. Indeed, I see no way to get MN’s purport out of the stanza. In the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00039.xml">Māṁgallu grant</ref>, Dānārṇava’s mother’s name is said to be Aṅkidevī. Secondary literature equates Aṅkidevī to Ūrjapā,<note>Based on the published estampage, an initial <foreign>ū</foreign> is perhaps more likely but the short <foreign>u</foreign> read by MN is also possible.</note> daughter of the king of Kaliṅga. But even if we assume that the two names denote one lady, and that Dānārṇava had the coronation name Bhīma (or <foreign>bhīmādhipo</foreign> is a scribal mistake for <foreign>dānādhipo</foreign>), we have the genitive <foreign>sūnoḥ</foreign> in the first quarter and the nominative <foreign>sūnuḥ</foreign> in the third. I see no way to interpret the stanza, even with emendations, as being about anything other than a Bhīma who is the son of the son of another Bhīma. This is true of Bhīma II, grandson of Bhīma I, and the stanza needs very little emendation (see the apparatus to lines 38 and 39) to become coherent. The stanza thus tells us that Ūrjapā was the wife of Vijayāditya IV Kollabigaṇḍa (not named, only described as the son of Bhīma I), and the mother of Bhīma II (<foreign>bhīmādhipa</foreign>), instead of being another name of Aṅkidevī, Bhīma II’s wife and the mother of Dānārṇava. The only problematic spot is the word I reconstruct as <foreign>naptuḥ</foreign>, shown in MN’s edition as <foreign>āptaḥ</foreign>. (It may be worth noting here that if “descendant of Kali Viṣṇu” is not utter confabulation in MN’s commentary, then he too may have read some form of the word <foreign>naptr̥</foreign> here, interpreting it as “descendant.”) I do not expect a description of Dānārṇava to single out an ancestor as distant of Kali Viṣṇuvardhana, but his appearance becomes understandable if we interpret the stanza to mean that Bhīma I was the grandson of Kali Viṣṇuvardhana. Since Bhīma I’s father Vikramāditya never ruled, it is reasonable that his grandfather is named instead. (Alternatively, the genitive <foreign>naptuḥ</foreign> may qualify <foreign>sūnoḥ</foreign>, in which case it describes Vijayāditya IV as the great-grandson of Kali Viṣṇuvardhana; see e.g. the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00003.xml">Timmapuram plates of Viṣṇuvardhana I</ref> for <foreign>naptr̥</foreign> in the sense of “great-grandson.”) It is thus beyond reasonable doubt that stanza XVI is about the birth of Bhīma II. However, the next stanzas do not continue the genealogy and probably describe Dānārṇava, since there is no reason for the eulogy to praise Bhīma II at length here, and stanza XIX is certainly about Dānārṇava. It seems most likely that a stanza, describing the birth of Dānārṇava from Bhīma II and Aṅkidevī, was omitted after this one.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="18">Although partially lost, this verse seems to use the Telugu <foreign>prāsa</foreign>: the second syllables of the extant lines are <foreign>lye</foreign>, <foreign>dyā</foreign> and <foreign>ya</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="21">This badly damaged stanza must be a <foreign>mālabhāriṇī</foreign> given the prosody of the extant fragments, but the end of the stanza does not fit the metre. The total length of the lacuna is expected to be around 16 to 18 characters. My proposed distribution of the text into <foreign>pāda</foreign>s results in a lacuna of 19 characters, slightly longer than expected but definitely within possibility. I further propose that two characters were omitted by the scribe in the last quarter, which may originally have run something like <foreign>bhajati prāpta-vasur vasundharāyāṁ</foreign>, where <foreign>bhajati</foreign> is a guess, but <foreign>-vasur vasundharāyāṁ</foreign> would be metrically correct and prone to eyeskip omission.</p>
