L1. BI note that the reading mureṇa would mean that this verse is still mythological rather than genealogical, which is problematic because v3 implies that a king or dynasty has been introduced before. Bakker_1997:163 proposes to read dūreṇa, but ū seems unlikely from the photo. Since most of this verse is lost, one could assume that it contained a metaphor that uses Mura as an analogue of someone defeated by a king introduced in the lost part.
--><!--
L1. BI note that rṣi is not quite the form one would expect (compare l13), but still the most likely reading.

L1. Bakker_1997:163 proposes to restore samudraguptaḥ in v2a, but Bakker (2012) rejects the idea later on.

L2. Bakker_1997:163 offers the reconstruction tīkṣṇa for the beginning of v3. There are plenty of other possibilities.
--><!--
L2. BI print pra as unclear but I see no recognisable trace except a vertical on the right.
--><!--
L2. BI read °odgata as clear; I think °oddhata is at least as likely and perhaps better in context.
--><!--
L2. pā and pī are almost clear.
--><!--
L2. I follow BI in assuming that v3ab is one long compound, thus supplying ṭha- at the end of 3a. However, I think it's also quite possible that 2a was a locative qualifying pāde in 3d, and 2b was a separate plural genitive qualifying nr̥pāṇām. (See also my note below.)

L2. I adopt all BI's readings in v3b for want of a better reading. They propose to resrore prabhā on the grounds that would provide assonance with prabhāva in 3a and be consonant with the frequent usage of (pra)+√bhā in the inscription. In the photo, the illegible character seems to have a loop at the left. Also, pra is unclear, though very likely. In dhr̥ti they show r̥ as clear, but in the photo it looks more like a subscript r, and the character could be well be pra (dh is definitely narrower in dhi later on in this line). Their sthā seems to have a loop at the left and is in my opinion more likely to be ṣṭhā, which would give pratiṣṭhā instead of the unintelligible dhr̥ti-sthālana. But even if we do read pratiṣṭhā, I cannot make sense of lana, which is quite clear. Emend to laya, giving us pratiṣṭhā+ālaya? Or perhaps read lava? Further, the character read as ñci looks more like ñchi, but that would seem improbable in the context. I would hazard reading/restoring X X prabhāvoddhata-pāda-pīṭhe / prabhā-pratiṣṭhā-lava-vañcitānām, interpreting 3b as "(kings) divested (vañcita) of their meagre (lava) glory and status / of the [last] shreds of their glory and status."
--><!--
L2. I must note that the damaged area after (ñc)i is large enough to accommodate four characters. Still, more than two would be metrically imposible - was there perhaps punctuation and space?
-->
<l n="c">yasyottamāṅgair bbalayo kriyant<supplied reason="lost"><!-- CHECK if <unclear> applies better.-->e</supplied></l><!--
L2. I follow BI in restoring kriyante, but given the sandhi in bbalayo, perhaps kriyanta (for akriyanta) is the correct restoration.

L2. BI offer °prānta-balasya as a restoration in 4a, but note that this is palaeographically unlikely. Bakker_1997:163 suggests °prānta-palāyamānām. I think the illegible character before l looks most like va or perhaps vi. (BI also note that this character may have had an i mātrā.) Perhaps vilaṅghitasya? Or vilāsa-something?

L3. Bakker_1997:164 proposes pitur gr̥hītā, but Bakker (2010) rejects this.
--><!--
L3. For the end of 5b, BI offer pratiṣiddha or possibly pratiṣikta; Bakker_1997:164 tentatively restores pratiṣiddha-śakteḥ. BI say the main image is "that of a young girl growing up and increasing in brightness like a flame shooting up from a fire on which ghee has been poured." I might add that perhaps the image is that of the girl growing up in his father's house, then flaring up into a flame _after_ she married into another house (even sikta could be taken as a hint at her marriage). Can this be about Prabhāvatīguptā, or does she only enter the picture later? If we read ṣī instead of ṣi, we could have pratiṣīdamānā or, rejecting pra (which is not recognisable in the photo), viṣīdamānā. This would fit in very nicely with my interpretation, though it must be admitted the character after (ṣ)I has a hook below it, looking like the bottom of k, but possibly a partially preserved dh. On a different note, if I stick with my understanding that this is about her marriage, and accept my take on 5c, then we lack a verbal form saying she got married. This can't fit in c or d, so perhaps restore pitur gr̥hāt, followed by something to this effect?
--><!--
L3. The lacuna between 5b and 5c is again longer than required for the letters - punctuation and/or space?
-->
<l n="c"><seg met="=+"><gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="character"/></seg> <supplied reason="lost"><!-- CHECK if <unclear> applies better.-->yay</supplied>au vr̥d<unclear>dh</unclear>i<unclear>kaṁ</unclear> <supplied reason="lost"><!-- CHECK if <unclear> applies better.-->cāna</supplied>lasya</l><!--
L3. For the beginning of 5c, Bakker_1997:164 offers the conjectures kanyā or śuddhā.
--><!--
L3. BI's reading/restoration vr̥ddhikaṁ cānalasya is unmetrical, and there doesn't seem to be enough space for cāna between ka(ṁ) and la. The word vr̥ddhika is also rather awkward. I have no solution for the problem, but could it be possible to read vr̥ddhikarīṁ? What seems to be an anusvāra over ka may be meant for rī. My proposed rī is itself indiscernible, but it is just possible that there was a long vertical with a circle on top here. We would then need to assume one more character after this, which must be quite narrow and yield a meaning ful word with lasya. On a hunch I would propose kulasya. The substantive qualified by vr̥ddhikarī could be the first two syllables of 5c, and a word meaning fire (e.g. vahneḥ) could be at the end of 5d.
-->
<l n="d">prājyājya-s<supplied reason="lost"><!-- CHECK if <unclear> applies better.-->i</supplied>ktasya śikheva <seg met="+="><gap reason="illegible" quantity="2" unit="character"/></seg></l><!--
L3. BI suggest śuddhā as a possible restoration at the end of v5, expecting an adjective qualifying both the flame and the girl. As above, I would (just as tentatively) suggest vahneḥ.

L3. Again we have more space than required between śikheva and tāṁ - there may have been punctuation and/or space here.
--><!--
L3. To BI's musings that there is no way to decide if nābhyunnata includes the negative na, or an instrumental ending, or even an a-stem in compoun, I would add yet another possibility: that this is a description of the lady's beauty, and we have something+nābhi (nimna-nābhi), followed in compound with unnata+something.

L4. BI propose to restore putreṣu guṇānviteṣu in 7b; or, at any rate, a substantive meaning son and a qualifier to that word. There may be faint traces of p after jāteṣu, and ṇā is very plausible, though far from certain, before nvi. Nothing in between is recognisable, though the second character in the lacuna may have had a subscript y, in which case it was not putreṣu.
--><!--
L4. The space between 7b and 7c is again larger than necessary, and there may be visible punctuation here, looking like a horizontal dash after ṣu. Also, nviteṣu is widely spaced and te is extended horizontally, with a large Kannada-type pr̥ṣṭhamātrā.

L4. BI suggest the name may have been Cāmuṇḍā (the shortening permitted by Pāṇini 6.3.36 and common in Vākāṭaka inscriptions). Bakker_1997:164 prefers to restore sā muṇḍa-, taking the name to be Muṇḍā and linking it to Mo(nd)asvāmin in #IN00182:2. The idea is very attractive, but I find sā extremely awkward; if the name had been Muṇḍā, then sā could have been avoided very easily (e.g. muṇḍābhibhānā). The traces of an ā mātrā are indeed quite distinct; the character itself could be just about anything that does not go outside the middle box area.
--><!--
L4. At the end of v7, yā babhūva is plausible but in the photo, only an ā mātrā is recognisable. Nothing is visible of y; there are faint traces that may be ba.

L4. There is space for about 4-5 characters between the estimated end of babhūva in v7 and the first extant character, le, in v8. Again, there may have been punctuation in here.
--><!--
L4. I adopt BI's tentative reading lekhāmi (which they only interpret to the extent that it contans the noun lekhā, presumably in a comparison to a sliver of the moon in the continued description of the lady's beauty). However, I personally find khā not very likely; the second extant character seems to be ṇa. If so, then the string leṇami would begin at the fifth syllable of the quarter, not at the fourth. This would mean that there is no lekhā, but an instrumental of a word that contains an r to account for the cerebralisation. (The string could also begin at the third syllable, but I find that less likely both on the basis of available space and because I can't think of a two syllable word ending in la and beginning with r.)

L5. BI note that the reading paripūrṇṇa-vr̥ttaḥ, of which they are "fairly confident", may be a pun on the moon. To this I might add that, taken in conjunction with sadaiva, this actually says CG was better than the moon, being always paripūrṇa.
--><!--
L5. As BI observe, the beginning of 9c almost certainly contained a verb meaning "gave", e.g. dadau. In addition, it may have contained the beginning of a feminine adjective in the accusative agreeing with the girl, or, much more likely, a masculine plural genitive such as prajānām (as proposed in Bakker_1997:164).

L8. BI propose to restore the lacuna in 15b as prīṇāti nīlā°. As they observe, the structure of the verse is that someone - presumably the king - does something - presumably pleases - a series of X-s by a series of Y-s, with some of the X-s being themselves structures of "the Z of X". Now restoring prīṇāti nīlā° would leave us without a Z of the ladies as well as without a Y to please them with. A Z is required here on account of the genitive (though, as BI note, manāṁsi may apply here too); the Y may have been omitted but this would have been strange. All in all, I'd rather restore prītyā, and assume that the remaining syllables told us what the Z of the ladies was, probably in the plural accusative masculine (°ān ambu°) or neuter (°āny ambu°). Possibly: prītyāśayān amburuhekṣaṇānāM. The verb meaning "please" would then have to have been in pāda c along with the subject, which, in my opinion, is a very plausible structure for the stanza as a whole.
