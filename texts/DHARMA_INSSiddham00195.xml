L1. BI note that the reading mureṇa would mean that this verse is still mythological rather than genealogical, which is problematic because v3 implies that a king or dynasty has been introduced before. Bakker_1997:163 proposes to read dūreṇa, but ū seems unlikely from the photo. Since most of this verse is lost, one could assume that it contained a metaphor that uses Mura as an analogue of someone defeated by a king introduced in the lost part.

          <!-- 
L2. I adopt all BI's readings in v3b for want of a better reading. They propose to resrore prabhā on the grounds that would provide assonance with prabhāva in 3a and be consonant with the frequent usage of (pra)+√bhā in the inscription. In the photo, the illegible character seems to have a loop at the left. Also, pra is unclear, though very likely. In dhr̥ti they show r̥ as clear, but in the photo it looks more like a subscript r, and the character could be well be pra (dh is definitely narrower in dhi later on in this line). Their sthā seems to have a loop at the left and is in my opinion more likely to be ṣṭhā, which would give pratiṣṭhā instead of the unintelligible dhr̥ti-sthālana. But even if we do read pratiṣṭhā, I cannot make sense of lana, which is quite clear. Emend to laya, giving us pratiṣṭhā+ālaya? Or perhaps read lava? Further, the character read as ñci looks more like ñchi, but that would seem improbable in the context. I would hazard reading/restoring X X prabhāvoddhata-pāda-pīṭhe / prabhā-pratiṣṭhā-lava-vañcitānām, interpreting 3b as "(kings) divested (vañcita) of their meagre (lava) glory and status / of the [last] shreds of their glory and status."

L3. Bakker_1997:164 proposes pitur gr̥hītā, but Bakker (2010) rejects this. 
-->
          <!-- 
L3. For the end of 5b, BI offer pratiṣiddha or possibly pratiṣikta; Bakker_1997:164 tentatively restores pratiṣiddha-śakteḥ. BI say the main image is "that of a young girl growing up and increasing in brightness like a flame shooting up from a fire on which ghee has been poured." I might add that perhaps the image is that of the girl growing up in his father's house, then flaring up into a flame _after_ she married into another house (even sikta could be taken as a hint at her marriage). Can this be about Prabhāvatīguptā, or does she only enter the picture later? If we read ṣī instead of ṣi, we could have pratiṣīdamānā or, rejecting pra (which is not recognisable in the photo), viṣīdamānā. This would fit in very nicely with my interpretation, though it must be admitted the character after (ṣ)I has a hook below it, looking like the bottom of k, but possibly a partially preserved dh. On a different note, if I stick with my understanding that this is about her marriage, and accept my take on 5c, then we lack a verbal form saying she got married. This can't fit in c or d, so perhaps restore pitur gr̥hāt, followed by something to this effect?

L3. For the beginning of 5c, Bakker_1997:164 offers the conjectures kanyā or śuddhā.

          <!-- 
L3. BI's reading/restoration vr̥ddhikaṁ cānalasya is unmetrical, and there doesn't seem to be enough space for cāna between ka(ṁ) and la. The word vr̥ddhika is also rather awkward. I have no solution for the problem, but could it be possible to read vr̥ddhikarīṁ? What seems to be an anusvāra over ka may be meant for rī. My proposed rī is itself indiscernible, but it is just possible that there was a long vertical with a circle on top here. We would then need to assume one more character after this, which must be quite narrow and yield a meaning ful word with lasya. On a hunch I would propose kulasya. The substantive qualified by vr̥ddhikarī could be the first two syllables of 5c, and a word meaning fire (e.g. vahneḥ) could be at the end of 5d.

L4. BI suggest the name may have been Cāmuṇḍā (the shortening permitted by Pāṇini 6.3.36 and common in Vākāṭaka inscriptions). Bakker_1997:164 prefers to restore sā muṇḍa-, taking the name to be Muṇḍā and linking it to Mo(nd)asvāmin in #IN00182:2. The idea is very attractive, but I find sā extremely awkward; if the name had been Muṇḍā, then sā could have been avoided very easily (e.g. muṇḍābhibhānā). The traces of an ā mātrā are indeed quite distinct; the character itself could be just about anything that does not go outside the middle box area.

L4. I adopt BI's tentative reading lekhāmi (which they only interpret to the extent that it contans the noun lekhā, presumably in a comparison to a sliver of the moon in the continued description of the lady's beauty). However, I personally find khā not very likely; the second extant character seems to be ṇa. If so, then the string leṇami would begin at the fifth syllable of the quarter, not at the fourth. This would mean that there is no lekhā, but an instrumental of a word that contains an r to account for the cerebralisation. (The string could also begin at the third syllable, but I find that less likely both on the basis of available space and because I can't think of a two syllable word ending in la and beginning with r.)

L8. BI propose to restore the lacuna in 15b as prīṇāti nīlā°. As they observe, the structure of the verse is that someone - presumably the king - does something - presumably pleases - a series of X-s by a series of Y-s, with some of the X-s being themselves structures of "the Z of X". Now restoring prīṇāti nīlā° would leave us without a Z of the ladies as well as without a Y to please them with. A Z is required here on account of the genitive (though, as BI note, manāṁsi may apply here too); the Y may have been omitted but this would have been strange. All in all, I'd rather restore prītyā, and assume that the remaining syllables told us what the Z of the ladies was, probably in the plural accusative masculine (°ān ambu°) or neuter (°āny ambu°). Possibly: prītyāśayān amburuhekṣaṇānāM. The verb meaning "please" would then have to have been in pāda c along with the subject, which, in my opinion, is a very plausible structure for the stanza as a whole.
