              <p>The inscription contains halantas. However, they are not always discernible purely based on their shape which might be due to the quality of the published picture. Halanta N is written slightly smaller (apart from 
              <foreign>akuN</foreign>in line 4 where the N is very small) and lacks the horizontal line on top of the 
              <foreign>akṣara</foreign>. Halanta M is still rudimentarily visible on the picture but can not be clearly delineated from ⟨ma⟩ in line 1 and 4. The 
              <foreign>akṣara</foreign>⟨ḻa⟩ is written in the standard form in line 3 (i. e. resembling a softly drawn w with inwardly curled edges) but is written with the curled edges drawn right into the middle so that they meet (like in the process of cellular meiosis) in line 1. The 
              <foreign>akṣara</foreign>⟨le⟩ is written with the vowel element almost forming a circle on top. This form of ⟨le⟩ albeit unusual can be found in several other inscriptions.</p>

                 The inscription was published twice by Sōmaśēkhara Śarma whose second edition I could not obtain. The text as published by Radha Krishna, however, may reflect this second edition that seems to basically only differ in the correct representation of the 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ḻ⟩ as opposed to the edition in Vyāsasaṁgrahamu. The 
<foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ḻ⟩ is clearly written in the inscription. The spelling ⟨ṣja⟩ in Sōmaśēkhara Śarma's first edition must have been chosen due to the lack of a proper printing option at the time.
                 The reading as presented here is my own based on the picture in Vyāsasaṁgrahamu. The deviating readings as published by Radha Krishna have been assigned to himself although they may reflect the readings in Sōmaśēkhara Śarma's second edition.
                 Lines 1-4 are written on the broader and polished side of the "red stone" (యెర్రరాయి) and line 5 on either side of the stone (
<bibl>
  <ptr target="bib:SomasekharaSarma1933_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">301, 304</citedRange>
</bibl>).
                 Sōmaśēkhara Śarma interpreted 
<foreign>Aṇapotulu</foreign> (with short o) to be a Prakrit form of 
<foreign>ājñāpati</foreign> or 
<foreign>ājñapti</foreign> (with Telugu plural suffix) and read 
<foreign>oḷana</foreign> (instead of 
<foreign>ēḷaN</foreign>) which he phrased as "in subordination to" (అధీనతయందలి) or "in the authority of" (అధికారమునందలి) (the ruler) (
<bibl rend="omitname">
  <ptr target="bib:SomasekharaSarma1933_01" />
  <citedRange unit="page">308-309</citedRange>
</bibl>). In this case the donation would have been made by the ruler and the two other persons could have been 
<foreign>ājñaptis</foreign> although the syntax would be a little bit odd. It may be noted that in Sōmaśēkhara Śarma's Telugu translation 
<foreign>Aṇapōtulu</foreign> is written (with long ō), probably by mistake. As it seems to me the inscription provides the usual formula 
<hi rend="italic">XYZ ēḷaN</hi> which only refers to the reign of a ruler so that the agents (donors) are the three other persons. 
                 The name 
<foreign>Aṇapōtulu</foreign> is a honorific plural and seems to consist of 
<foreign>a(ṇ)ṇa</foreign> 'elder brother' (normally used as second element in names) and 
<foreign>pōtu</foreign> 'male'. The same elements in a different order can be found in the name of the poet 
<foreign>Pōtana</foreign> (with later decerebralization).
                 The place that is referred to in the inscription (
<foreign>In-puḻōlu</foreign> 'this city') must be either Poṭladurti or Mālēpāḍu because the inscription was found near the road between these two villages.
                                  Another inscription that mentions the rule of Cōḻa-Mahārāja and the scribe Asivairuvu is DHARMA_INSTelugu00015.

               The inscription was published by Sōmaśēkhara Śarma in Vyāsa-Saṁgrahamu together with a picture, a discussion and a translation into modern Telugu. The same author later published another article on the inscription in Āndhra Patrika. I could not obtain this latter article. The inscription was re-published by K. M. Sastri, who added an English translation, and B. Radha Krishna.
