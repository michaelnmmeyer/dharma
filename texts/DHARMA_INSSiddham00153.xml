The marginal mangala symbol is before the beginning of line 3. It is a dextrorse spiral resembling a figure 6.

Thaplyal prints śrīman instead of śrīmān in l1. The ā mātrā is clear; it is small, but no smaller than in other mā-s in the inscription; compare the ma-s earlier in this line. Probably a typo in Thaplyal.

Fleet reads °tām anur in l1, noting that Wilkins and Mitra read °tāṁ manur in l1, but there is no anusvāra. This is true, but I concur with Kielhorn (1891:189) and Thaplyal that the intent must have been Manu, not Anu.
--><!--
Verse-end punctuation, here and throughout, is a double vertical. Quarter-end punctuation, where present, is a single short horizontal. The ends of odd quarters are always marked by a distinct space of 1-2 characters (in the middle of each physical line, giving the text the appearance of two columns). Actually, it seems that quarter-end daṇḍas are used where the inline space is smallest (lines 3 and 4), and omitted where the space is larger. Halfverse-end daṇḍas seem to be used where the halfverse does not end in a visarga. Possibly the spaces should be added to the transcribed text.

The visarga of hitaḥ in l3 is clear, but Kielhorn is probably right in saying that the text should be emended to para-hita-śrī-pauruṣaḥ.

Fleet reads a daṇḍa after 3a (after anta) and explicitly notes that it should be ignored, construing anta in compound with vyakta. As Thaplyal notes, no such daṇḍa is visible in the rubbing.

Note the lack of sandhi at the end of 3c - another indication, like the occasional quarter-verse daṇḍas, that the pāda-yati was perceived just as powerful as the ardhaśloka-yati (though the compound crossing the pāda boundary in 3ab seems to point the other way - I'm not sure I've ever seen such a thing in a long metre).

Fleet prints spr̥hābhiḥ in l6. As Thaplyal notes, no visarga is visible in the rubbing.

As in l5, Fleet reads a daṇḍa after 4a (after yantrā) and explicitly notes that it should be ignored, reading yantrād. As Thaplyal notes, no such daṇḍa is visible in the rubbing. There is, however, the usual space between yantrā and dvegā°.

Thaplyal prints vipathita in l8. Fleet reads vimathita and the character is clearly ma. Must be a typo in Thaplyal.
--><!--
Kielhorn wants to emend vājī to vāji- in compound, saying pravīro on its own cannot be taken as an adjective qualifying vāṇaḥ. I agree it is a bit strange, but don't see how reading a compound here would improve the sense.

Obscured caesura in 4a.

Fleet reads a daṇḍa after 4c (after pravīro) and explicitly notes that it should be ignored. As Thaplyal notes, no such daṇḍa is visible in the rubbing.

</lg><!--
Fleet reads nāmnā at the end and notes that the visarga was first omitted and then added partly over the first vertical of the punctuation sign. I assume this was intended as a correction, so even if the ā mātrā is not visibly deleted, I mark it up as corrected.
--><!--
Line 9 is in the same type of script as the body of the inscription, but the two are not necessarily related. Fleet (1888:225n7) explicitly states that the two have no connection. The characters are very slightly smaller than in the body, and also seem to be less deeply engraved. The text is just a little below line 8, beginning about two characters to the left of the margin. The characters are spaced (with a blank of about 2 characters' width between each). de is entangled with the bottom of dū in l8 (says Fleet and this is how it seems to me; Thaplyal, contrarily, states that "The plate ... shows only the upper half of the letter द and it is not mixed up with दू"); śa is below the space between prā and pī; va is below ma, and sa is below ga, touching the bottom of that character.
