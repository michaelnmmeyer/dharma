        <!--daba: I agree fully, and will be happy to go ahead with whatever Axelle suggests. I think the altIdentifier will have to go in the MS section regardless of what she does to the schema: here, we're giving the ID of this publication, of which there is only one; there, we give other IDs associated with the original text. Hand in hand with providing instructions for altIdentifier, we also need to provide for alternative titles (those in literature or Siddham) by which a user will be able find a text.-->

            <!-- argr2daba: I was wondering if the Siddham licence needs to be reproduced here. -->
            <!--daba: I think we need consultation on that. What I know is this: we never did put licence info inside the Siddham files. I've just checked and the siddham.network website offers its content under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licence, which may be a problem (ND = no derivatives). I wonder if that was done because Michael anticipated DHARMA wanting to reuse those files. However, the original XML files I uploaded to Zenodo (which are in fact what I imported now) are still there under a BY-SA licence, nothing about ND or even NC. (By the way, is there any reason why our files are only BY, without SA? That would mean that any derivatives made later will not have to credit us for the work, wouldn't it?) Should I try to discuss this with Michael? I'd like to avoid fuelling the bad blood between you two, and I would also like to remain on good terms with him, so I'm not very eager to do that, but all in all, it may be best if I initiate it. Also, as you say in your email, we should probably include a reference to the Siddham files. To simplify our lives (and to conform to fact), this could simply be the zip file containing all my XML files on Zenodo, rather than individual siddham.network URLs for each file. -->

Noteworthy shapes of M, ṅha.
Line 4: -svāmine: the ne has a special shape, apparely meant to reinforce the fact that the akṣara marks the end of a clause, a fact also indicated by following space.<!--daba: indeed. It actually looks rather like what I'd expect a halanta N to look like. Could this be one? Or perhaps a halanta N to which an e marker was added subsequently to change it to ne? Or, as you say, a halanta-ish shape used to indicate the pause (virāma) at this point. -->
Line 18: shape of gg in svargge.<!-- argr2daba: it rather looks like we have svargge, doesn't it? --><!--daba: probably, but this looks weird. I'd expect the second g to be more prominent, and attached to the right leg of the primary one - but this must be another cursive/unusual implementation of a subscript g. In line 8, ndhu is formed similarly, with the dh attached through a vertical line at the right, so here too, the vertical is probably for attachment, and the little thingy at its bottom is the second g. --></p>

"The ā mātrā at the end of l3 is far from clear. If it's ṇā, then we expect brāhmaṇāya, so the name of the donee is probably just one akṣara plus svāmin. Perhaps more probably, we have just brāhmaṇa, and then a two-syllable name."
argr adds: On inspection of the RTI, and presuming that my new reading adhikaraṇaM is the correct reading in line 1, then I find that there can be no serious doubt about the reading ṇa here, even if the akṣara as a whole is not as clear as it could be. That said, I don't find daba's argument about a hypothetical reading with -ṇā incontrovertible. In the Gaya plate there is vrāhmaṇagopadevasvāmine. If the reading is -ṇā, we could very well have a brahmin whose name started with A or Ā. --><!--daba: you are of course right that the name could have started with a or ā, so the brāhmaṇā does not necessarily imply brāhmaṇāya. But I think I disagree about reading ṇā here and in l1. I've just spent a short time looking at the RTI, so I don't want to contradict your judgement right out, but here's how it seems to me. 1. we have a clear ṇa in line 8 (°dhāraṇayā), in which the hook at the top right only extends downward for a short length (I haven't looked for other instances of ṇa, so this may be atypical, but it conforms to my expectations). 2. Clear specimens of ṇā (l3 °ṇāgrahārika; l9 kṣettrāṇām) have a second hook attached to the lower right of the body, bending down and back under the body. 3. The problematic characters (l1 and l3) have the upper right hook extended down below the baseline, then bending back under the body. My conclusion: the problematic characters are a cursive form of ṇā, in which the upper right hook of the body is extended to represent the hook that is the vowel marker. That stroke even has a curve toward the body in l1, and a definite cusp toward the body in l3, which to me indicates that the part of the stroke above that cusp/curve belongs to the body, and the part below it represents the vowel marker. In the RTI, the only thing unclear about the one in l3 is the centre of the body, but the stroke on the right is quite clear. Thus, I suggest reverting to adhikaraṇāM in l1 (could the composer have had adhikaraṇāḥ in mind, to go with the plural verbs?), and brāhmaṇā in l3. -->
<!-- response argr: I am still convinced we are dealing with ṇa in both cases. -->

            <note>Reading <foreign>ṇā</foreign> here would imply that the akṣara has a different shape from all other cases of <foreign>ṇā</foreign> in this inscription, which show a clockwise stroke at the bottom to make the <foreign>ā</foreign> (e.g. in line 9 <foreign>pratikarāṇāṁ</foreign>). By contrast, we can avoid the need to make any emendation by simply reading the expected <foreign>ṇa</foreign>, which does not seem problematic if we compare the forms of <foreign>ṇa</foreign> and M observed, e.g., in line 8 <foreign>avadhāraṇayā</foreign>, line 4 <foreign>atisraṣṭuM</foreign>, line 13 <foreign>dattaM</foreign>.<!--daba2argr: I concur that the M need not be involved, but I've now fully convinced myself that the stroke on the right is an alternative implementation of the ā marker.

          <!--daba: I don't insist, but here are some non-decisive reasons why it may be better to do that. 1. The amount of original work I did on Siddham inscriptions varies greatly, and if we decide to cite or not to cite Siddham on that basis, then in each case someone would have to judge whether or not it deserves to be cited. I definitely think that some of my Siddham inscriptions deserve it. 2. Sircar too did little more than reprint the text. 3. To stay on Michael's good side. // Then again, some likewise non-decisive reasons why not to: 1. The Siddham edition is credited anyway in the header. 2. I agree with you about there being no need (in this particular case) to cite any of my readings in the apparatus. So: I'm undecided. If you prefer no, I'm OK with that. -->
