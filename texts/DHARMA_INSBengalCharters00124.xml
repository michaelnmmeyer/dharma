daba: "1. I'm very hesitant about tṛtīya/dvitīya in line 2. It seems pretty certain that there was no i on the first obliterated character, so I think dvi can be ruled out. But with the ī of rī below, I also can't quite see where the ṛ of tṛ might have been placed. However, what's left of this first character does suggest the consonant t. And the third obliterated character seems to have been pretty wide, and may well have had a subscript y. Perhaps yyā rather than yā? Do you think svakīyyā° may be possible? (Though sva is also a bit problematic because of the presence of ī below.) Or svādhīnyā°? Or svavīryyā°? I can't think of anything plausible without an initial sva, it seems :) At any rate, I think that in addition to tṛtīyyā (or tṛtīyā), which I can't rule out, it's possible that there was no number (so "first" is to be understood), and the damaged word qualified abhyudaya, not sāmvatsara."
