<note>S suggests in a note that this word is redundant, but it is clear that he understands the following nominatives to refer to Viṣṇuvardhana. I concur, and therefore emend here and in the following words to a genitive. Compare the analogous

<note>The characters

<note>I presume that the full names of the donees are Vr̥ddha Maṇḍaśarman and Doṇaśarman, the former being the son of Doṇaśarman and the latter of Goḷaśarman. The text also permits the interpetation that the full names are Vr̥ddha Doṇaśarman and Maṇḍa Doṇaśarman.</note></p>
