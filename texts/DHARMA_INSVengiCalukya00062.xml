              <p>Halantas. Final N (l9) looks like a reduced and slightly lowered na with a long and straight vertical stem, no headmark. Final T (l13) is likewise a reduced and lowered ta with a (not so long) vertical stem, no headmark.</p>
              <p>Original punctuation marks. </p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally to the right of the character to which it belongs, at or slightly above headline height; quite often atop the next character (e.g. l7 maṁgi, l18 kuṭuṁbina); at least once atop the character to which it belongs (l14 śibiṁ). Jihvāmūlīya, identical in shape to m, occurs in line 28. Long initial Ī occurs in line 33. Short and long dependent i are indistinguishable most of the time, and are read as expected unless there is reason to read otherwise.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

            <note>NV's edition gives this chunk of text literally as <q>sva-vaśyār=aś=śrat=āviṣṭā</q>. This implies that he analysed the segment in a particular way, but I cannot understand his analysis. The last character probably does indeed have a small <foreign>ā</foreign> marker attached to it, and what resembles an <foreign>i</foreign> marker distorted by the overhanging descender of <foreign>pra</foreign> above is nothing but an oversized headmark. As for the meaning of this segment, the best I can propose is to emend to <foreign>sva-vaṁśyair āśritāviṣṭā</foreign>, with hypersandhi applied to <foreign>āśritāḥ</foreign> (or <foreign>viṣṭā</foreign> used instead of <foreign>āviṣṭā</foreign>). This is a tentative suggestion and therefore I choose not to include the emendation in the edition itself. See also my translation.</note>

            <note>The vertical stroke on the left of <foreign>śc</foreign> that I take to be an <foreign>e</foreign> marker may be just a slip of the chisel in the engraving of the subscript part of <foreign>tma</foreign> above. There is, moreover, a slight chance that a further vowel marker is attached on the top right; if this is a deliberate stroke, then it is probably a subsequent addition, since it mingles with the upper part of the following <foreign>ṇ</foreign>. The intended vowel might thus be <foreign>a</foreign>, <foreign>ā</foreign> or <foreign>o</foreign> in addition to <foreign>e</foreign>, which I deem to be most likely. I cannot interpret any of these readings and cannot offer a convincing emendation. If <foreign>caṇḍuka</foreign> is correct, this may mean a ball or a conglomerate (Schmidt’s addenda to the PW: <q xml:lang="deu">Ball, zusammengeballte Masse</q>), which does not seem appropriate but may have been used in the sense of a mass or multitude. If the correct reading is <foreign>coṇḍuka</foreign>, then the composer may have used the word <foreign>uṇḍuka</foreign> in the sense of "a lot of." Emending to <foreign>caiḍuka</foreign>, the word may have been <foreign>eḍuka</foreign>, for Buddhist (or Jain?) <foreign>stūpa</foreign>s. Emending to <foreign>candraka</foreign>, this might be a technical term for a particular kind of <foreign>vedikā</foreign>; emending to <foreign>cendraka</foreign> may likewise result in <foreign>indraka</foreign> as a technical term. All of these words are, however, rare and barely or not at all attested in meanings that may be appropriate here. For want of a better reading/emendation, I provisionally believe <foreign>cendraka</foreign> to be the most likely, since this emendation presupposes a relatively minor graphical modification (<foreign>ṇḍu</foreign> engraved instead of <foreign>ndra</foreign>), and <foreign>indraka</foreign> can mean an audience chamber (as an asterisked entry in the PWG).</note>

            <note>This word may need emendation to <foreign>ambhodhiṁ</foreign>, but if this was the composer's intent, then I do not know the quality in which Vijayāditya surpasses the ocean. In other Eastern Cālukya inscriptions, kings are said to rival the ocean in profundity (<foreign>agādhatā</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00009.xml">Pedda-Vegi plates of Jayasiṁha I</ref> and <foreign>gambhīra-satva</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00019.xml">Pr̥thivipallavapaṭṭana grant of Viṣṇuvardhana IV or V</ref>) or in having great character (<foreign>mahā-satvatā</foreign> in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00023.xml">Ṭraṇḍapaṟu grant of Vijayāditya III</ref>, punningly in the case of the ocean); this latter stands right next to a claim of rivalling the earth in forbearance (<foreign>kṣamāyāḥ kṣitir</foreign>). The composer may have clumsily adopted a slightly different stanza that mentioned the ocean in such a connection, or–somewhat awkwardly–<foreign>ambhodhi</foreign> can be understood in compound with <foreign>kṣamayā</foreign> in the sense of "inexhaustable".</note>

            <note>I do not understand NV's emendation; he may have meant to emend to <foreign>ivādvayāt</foreign>, but this does not make sense in the context. Since <foreign>kāma-mūrttir</foreign> is in the masculine, I expect something in this stanza to be about the king. In the script of the plates, the <foreign>akṣara</foreign>s <foreign>yā</foreign> and <foreign>ha</foreign> are very similar. In this locus, we definitely have the former, but I assume this to be a scribal mistake for a pre-drawn <foreign>ha</foreign>. The form <foreign>udvahat</foreign> is still problematic; it may have been used for the sake of the metre in place of <foreign>udavahat</foreign>, or may be a non-standard form for correct <foreign>udvahan</foreign>. Given my understanding of the narrative context, I consider the latter more likely; see also my translation.</note>

            <foreign>avabhr̥tha</foreign>
          </supplied> of the Aśvamedha sacrifice. His brother Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana <supplied reason="subaudible">reigned</supplied> for eighteen years. His son Jayasiṁha Vallabha <supplied reason="explanation">I</supplied>, for thirty-three years. His younger brother Indra Bhaṭṭāraka’s dear son Viṣṇurāja <supplied reason="explanation">Viṣṇuvardhana II</supplied>, for nine years. His son Maṅgi Yuvarāja, for twenty-five years. His son Jayasiṁha Vallabha <supplied reason="explanation">II</supplied>, the shelter of the complete world <supplied reason="explanation">

His elder brother Viṣṇuvardhana <supplied reason="explanation">III</supplied>, for thirty-seven years. His son Vijayāditya <supplied reason="explanation">I</supplied>, for nineteen years. His son Viṣṇurāja <supplied reason="explanation">Viṣṇuvardhana IV</supplied>, for thirty-six years. His dear son was Vijayāditya <supplied reason="explanation">II</supplied>.</p>
        <p n="1" rend="stanza">After he <supplied reason="explanation">Vijayāditya II</supplied>, having reigned for forty-one years, passed on to heaven, his son Viṣṇurāja <supplied reason="explanation">Viṣṇuvardhana V</supplied> completed two autumns <supplied reason="subaudible">as king</supplied>.<note>See the commentary for some thoughts on this awkward stanza. The original stanza that I hypothesise there would have much the same meaning except that it would claim forty years as Vijayāditya II’s reign, and would set up the completion of Viṣṇuvardhana V’s reign as an adverb of time for the following stanza rather than completing the sentence here.</note></p>
        <p n="2" rend="stanza">His eldest son, a pre-eminent hero, <seg cert="low">knows his own nature and does his duty. He has even presided over</seg> the royal might <supplied reason="explanation">

            <foreign>goṣṭha</foreign>
          </supplied>.<note>This is another extremely awkward stanza in the original. I translate the text with the fairly straightforward emendations noted in the apparatus for line 12. To make sense of the tortuous sentence, I assume from the historical context that the claim being made is that Vijayāditya III was authorised to dispose of some funds and/or troops of his Rāṣṭrakūṭa suzerain. However, my intuition is that the first hemistich was meant to be intelligible in itself (calling Vijayāditya an eminent hero who presided over assembly meetings), while the second hemistich was meant to claim that he made the <foreign>lakṣmī</foreign> of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas subject to his own will (implying a victory over the Rāṣṭrakūṭas). But to obtain this purport from the stanza as received and emendable in good conscience, grammar would have to be twisted far beyond the conventions of non-standard Sanskrit.</note></p>
        <p n="3" rend="stanza">He <seg cert="low">penetrated into</seg> the peripheral lands <seg cert="low">to where his dynastic relatives <supplied reason="explanation">cognates</supplied> had retreated</seg>. Felling trees and digging up mountains, he built <seg cert="low">halls and altars</seg>.<note>This stanza is even less intelligible than the previous one. See the apparatus to line 13. My translation reflects the tentative suggestions made in the apparatus notes. I assume that the stanza refers to Vijayāditya III rooting out his own rivals to the throne and simultaneously civilising the peripheries conquered in the course of this. It also seems possible that the first hemistich was intended simply to say that he conquered those peripheries, but I cannot suggest an emendation by which this purport could be obtained.</note></p>
        <p n="4" rend="stanza">By his generosity to those who seek his protection, he surmounts Dadhīca, the Maid’s Son <supplied reason="explanation">Karṇa</supplied>, Śibi, Gupta, Bhūriśravas and Bali; and by his ocean-like patience, <supplied reason="explanation">he surmounts</supplied> the earth.<note>Another problematic stanza; see the apparatus to line 14. I am confident in my emendation of the third <foreign>pāda</foreign> and my interpretation of the first three, but retain doubts about the intended meaning of the fourth quarter (for which see the apparatus note on <foreign>ambhodhi-</foreign>). The sage Dadhīca gave up his own bones when requested by Indra, so that a weapon could be fashioned from them. The Maid’s Son Karṇa (also called Kānīna in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00037.xml">Kalucuṁbaṟṟu grant of Amma II</ref>) cut off the breastplate that was fused to his body from birth at the request of Indra disguised as a Brahmin. Śibi fed his own flesh to Indra in the guise of a hawk to save Agni who in the guise of a pigeon asked for his protection. Bali’s generosity is probably his giving up of the world (or of his body) to Viṣṇu in his Vāmana incarnation. I do not know of any relevant notable act by Bhūriśravas, but he is said to have been generous to Brahmins. I have not the faintest idea who the Gupta mentioned here may have been.</note></p>
        <p n="5" rend="stanza">The beloved <supplied reason="omitted">wife</supplied> of this King Vijayāditya <supplied reason="explanation">III</supplied> named Guṇakkenalla is a great queen of illustrious lineage, called Cellakā.</p>
        <p n="6-7" rend="stanza">When upon her attainment of young womanhood he, like Kāma embodied, married this daughter of the Vallabha <supplied reason="explanation">Rāṣṭrakūṭa</supplied> king, who was like a divine damsel with her coquettish smile, King Vijayāditya <supplied reason="omitted">donated</supplied> a village in order to accumulate merit.<note>Stanza 7 consists only of one hemistich and lacks the expected finite verb “donated”. I believe this lack is a scribal omission and the composer’s original text would have included a second hemistich with that verb, along with some additional details (such as for whose merit the donation was made). NV interprets the text differently, seeing a finite verb in stanza 6 (“He married her” instead of my “When he married her”), and joins the single hemistich of stanza 7 to the following prose. Although that prose sentence does lack a subject, I find this interpretation unsatisfactory because it results in confused syntax in the metrical text, leaving the accusative <foreign>grāmaṁ</foreign> floating free without any context.</note></p>

          </supplied> as follows:</p>
        <p n="18-20">Let it be known that we, <supplied reason="subaudible">together</supplied> with Callakāryā,<note>The agent of giving is apparently expressed at least twice, once as <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> in line 18 and once as <foreign>mayā</foreign> in line 20. This is probably a simple oversight of the drafter of the text (compare the negligent composition of the next passage about the passing on of the donation). But it is also possible that in the legalese of the period, the stock phrase <foreign>viditam astu vo ’smābhiḥ</foreign> was understood to mean “let it be known to you from us”, i.e. that <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> was not perceived to be the agent of the donation, but that of the proclamation. To complicate matters, the instrumental <foreign>callakāryayā</foreign> may also have been meant to express the agent, perhaps in apposition to <foreign>mayā</foreign>. NV in fact interprets the text to say that the donor is the wife, while I prefer to understand that the formal donor is the king, but since the grant is being made on the occasion of his marriage, his newly wed wife is mentioned as co-donor. A further detail relevant to this difference of opinion is that by NV’s interpretation of stanzas 6 and 7 (with which I disagree), there is no indication that the grant was made on the occasion of the marriage.</note> have given the village named Ciṁbuluru to Vedayyaśarman, resident of Nandiyala, of the Murggali <foreign>gotra</foreign>,<note>As NV observes, Murggali may perhaps be a corruption of the name Maudgalya.</note> grandson of Madhuvayyaśarman and son of Viṣṇuśarman.</p>
        <p n="20-25">Vedayyaśarman, in turn, <supplied reason="subaudible">has given</supplied> the entire village to Brahmins engaged in the the six duties <supplied reason="explanation">of a Brahmin</supplied>, who know all the treatises <supplied reason="explanation">

The village named Ciṁbuluru has been given, exempt from all taxes, on the occasion of an eclipse of the moon, <supplied reason="subaudible">the donation being</supplied> sanctified by <supplied reason="explanation">a libation of</supplied> water.<note>This passage is awkwardly phrased. I translate by dividing it up into two sentences, in which case a verb must be supplied for the first. If we are to understand it as a single sentence, then the donated object is specified twice, once correctly in the nominative right before the passive verb, and another time, redundantly and incorrectly in the accusative, at the beginning after the subject expressed by a nominative. The drafter of the text probably did not pause to consider such niceties, but simply took the standard text of a grant and carelessly inserted in it a new bit about the passing on of the donation. The remission of all taxes appears at the end, whereas I would expect this to be mentioned where the king’s gift is spoken of (remission of taxes being the king’s prerogative). I also find the reference to an eclipse slightly problematic. Was the grant made on the occasion of the king’s marriage or that of an eclipse? The eclipse may have happened so close to the marriage that a need was felt to avert its inauspicious influence by making a grant. But if so, the eclipse too ought to be mentioned next to the king’s gift, and not after describing the passing on of the donation. Or was there no eclipse at all, and was this word simply retained from a previous grant that an inattentive composer used as a template for the present one?</note></p>

I am quite confident of my reconstruction, even though it involves a fair amount of emendation. The verse plays on the words <foreign>dehi</foreign>, “give” and <foreign>dehī</foreign> “embodied being”. I understand its essence to be that one with the temerity to ask (and, by extension, take by force) something from a Brahmin (whose nature is to ask for, and receive, donations), will be reborn as an animal and will thus not be able to speak at all.</note></p>

NV says in his discussion that the text was composed by Bhaṭṭa Niravadya of Kolle, but the text contains no indication that the composer is being named here.

      <div type="commentary">
        <p n="1" rend="stanza">As indicated in the apparatus for lines 11-12, the received text is problematic here. In the edition, I emend and hyphenate in the way that seems most straightforward, by and large in agreement with NV’s emendations. However, with these straightforward emendations the grammar is poor and the meaning is intelligible only with a deal of goodwill. See the translation for my understanding of how the syntax was meant to work out and to connect to the preceding prose. The first quarter of this stanza is moreover unmetrical, though the composer may have thought of it as a “<foreign>ta-vipulā</foreign>” <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> variant. I believe that at least part of the reason for the metrical and syntactical awkwardness is that a pre-existing stanza that stated Vijayāditya II’s reign to have lasted forty years has been clumsily modified to a reign of forty-one years.  The length of this king’s reign is variously recorded as 40, 44 or 48 years in later grants, but apparently the earliest grants that mention lengths of reigns (mostly unpublished, but summarised by <bibl>
            <ptr target="bib:Venkataramanayya1974_03"/>
            <citedRange>9</citedRange>
          </bibl>)) state his reign as either 40 or 41 years. The hypothetical original stanza may have run something like this: <foreign>catvāriṁśat samā rājyaṁ kr̥tvā sura-padaṁ gate| ’smiṁs tat-sute viṣṇurāje kr̥tvā śarad-dvayaṁ tathā||</foreign><note>The prosodic pattern ⏑– (the first two syllables of the word <foreign>surālayaṁ</foreign>) is not acceptable for the third to fourth syllables of the second <foreign>pāda</foreign>, so I assume that the original stanza had a different word here, such as <foreign>sura-padaṁ</foreign>.</note> or, with a different take on the second hemistich, <foreign>asmiṁs tasya sute viṣṇurāje kr̥ta-śarad-dvaye</foreign>. Further alternatives with much the same meaning can be found with similarly small emendations, resulting in a stanza with correct syntax and seamless embedding in the context.</p>
        <p n="1" rend="stanza">A further interesting detail of this stanza or passage is that while NV interprets <foreign>śarad-dvayam</foreign> to mean “two years,” the reign of Viṣṇuvardhana V is recorded as either 18 or 20 months not only in later grants, but also in all grants of Vijayāditya III from which NV extracted the relevant data (loc. cit.), with the present grant being the sole exception. It thus seems likely that <foreign>śarad</foreign> was used deliberately by the composer to imply that although his reign incorporated two autumns, it did not last two full years.</p>

It may be interesting to see whether any of these occur in Rāṣṭrakūṭa grants, or if not, then where else they may have been adopted from.</p>
