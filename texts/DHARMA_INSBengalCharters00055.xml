In my opinion, the translation allows to find an equivalent or to give a base to understand what is behind this expression, but it refers to a system coming from the Roman antiquity. For this reason, I think this translation does not fit. In French, one could translate by <q><foreign>conseil communal</foreign></q> to remove the reference of Roman antiquity, but the equivalent words in English seem to be <q>town</q>, <q>city</q>, <q>village</q> or <q>local</q>.

                         The lacuna consisting of nine <foreign>akṣara</foreign>s line 9 may be reconstructed in two different ways by taking the context into account. The first possibility, suggested in <bibl><ptr target="bib:Griffiths2018_02"/><citedRange unit="page">38</citedRange></bibl>, is based on the beginining of the text and fills in the lacuna with <foreign>maddhyamasr̥gālikāyā</foreign>, place name founded in compound with Śiṣīpuñja in line 2. The second possibility is based on the continuation of the text. As the three monasteries are mentioned by the compound <foreign>śiṣīpuñja-śrīgohālī-grāmakūṭagohālyāñ ca vihāratrayy<supplied reason="lost">āṁ</supplied></foreign> line 16 and as one can read the repetition of the word <foreign>vihāra</foreign> in a compound <foreign><gap reason="lost" unit="character" quantity="2"/>ṇḍanakār<unclear>i</unclear>taka-vihāra<gap reason="lost" unit="character" quantity="4"/>vihāra-tray<choice><sic>asya</sic><corr>yāṁ</corr></choice></foreign>, the part of the lacuna may also be filled in with °<foreign>vihāraśrīgohālī</foreign>°.

                <p>This plate measures 13.5 cm in height and 23.3 cm in width. In its left margin we see a semicircular extension with a rectangular hole in the middle: this is where a seal would originally have been affixed. This seal is unfortunately lost. The plate has suffered badly from corrosion, but thanks to the repetition of long strings of text in two parts of the inscription it has been possible to read or restore most of it — 14 lines on the obverse, 13 on the reverse. It records a donation in favor of three monasteries whose affiliation with Jainism is revealed by a string of unique or rarely attested terms (see <bibl><ptr target="bib:Griffiths2018_02"/><citedRange unit="page">45-50</citedRange></bibl> and below). The grant must be compared with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00034.xml">Jagadishpur plate</ref>, dated 128 GE, and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00052.xml">Paharpur plate</ref>, dated 159 GE, both in favor of Jaina ascetics. This new grant is, like the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00052.xml">Paharpur plate</ref>, issued from the capital of Puṇḍravardhana. It figures anonymous officials addressing householders in the localities Śiṣīpuñja, Madhyamasr̥gālikā and Grāmakūṭagohālī to order execution of a donation petitioned and paid for by a certain Nāgavasu. He spent a sum of 4 <foreign>dīnāra</foreign> coins, for a total of 2 <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign>s, covering three distinct parcels of waste land, to be given to the monasteries in the mentioned localities, for the sustenance of the monks, for the regular performance of worship, and for the maintenance of the buildings. A number of named record-keepers figure as authorities confirming the local price of a <foreign>kulyavāpa</foreign> of waste land. Two of the usual admonitory stanzas on land donation are cited in the final part of the inscription, which closes with a colophon containing a date in the month of Śrāvaṇa in year 198 of the Gupta era, corresponding to around 518 CE, making this the latest inscription but one of the Gupta period in the Puṇḍravardhana area.</p>

             <p>The majority of the beneficiaries of the grants recorded in our corpus are Vedic Brahmins, and the epigraphic material of early Bengal has already been analysed from the point of view of the social history of the Brahmins. The new plates published here do not contain any new data beyond additions to the prosopographic database that has been compiled and recently published by <bibl><ptr target="bib:Furui2017_01"/></bibl>. I refer therefore to the same scholar’s article presenting a synthesis on the history of Brahmins in the early history of Bengal (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Furui2013_01"/></bibl>), with the updated perspectives formulated in his more recent contribution (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Furui2017_01"/><citedRange unit="page">181-2</citedRange></bibl>: 181–182). Since they are not cited by Furui, I mention here also the important overview of earlier philological and historical work by <bibl><ptr target="bib:Witzel1993_01"/></bibl> and a recent study by <bibl><ptr target="bib:Schmiedchen2007_01"/></bibl>, which offers important comments on the social realities behind the term cāturvidya ‘belonging to the community of [Brahmins] studying the four Vedas’, that we have encountered above in the Raktamālā plate #2, notably with regard to the question whether the term is evidence or not for the presence of Brahmins affiliated to the Atharvaveda. So far, the corpus has brought us evidence only of named Brahmins belonging to the White Yajurveda (<foreign>vājasaneya</foreign>) and Sāmaveda (<foreign>chandoga</foreign>) traditions.
              </p>
                 <p>The corpus also contains a small number of grants to temples (<ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00049.xml">Baigram</ref>, <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00053.xml">Damodarpur #4</ref>), but none of the new plates belongs to this subgroup. Besides the two donations to Brahmins recorded in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00057.xml">Raktamālā plate #2</ref> and in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00051.xml">Tāvīra grant</ref>, the new material contains a donation made to a group of three monasteries which I have above identified as Jaina. This identification was not immediately evident to me when I started studying the inscription, in part because of the poor state of preservation of the plate. I will present here the evidence which led to the conclusion that we are dealing with a grant to Jaina monks.
                 </p>
                 <p>It will be helpful to start by repeating the two relevant passages from Nāgavasu’s grant, which express twice almost exactly the same information, restored and emended in accordance with my edition and notes above:
</p>
                    <p n="5-10"> From <foreign>śiṣīpuñja</foreign>- to -<foreign>saṁskārādyopayo</foreign>
                    </p>
                 <p n="16-20">From <foreign>śiṣīpuñja</foreign>- to <foreign>saṁskārādyartthaṁ</foreign>-.</p>
                 <p>In interpreting these passages, I was for a long time on the wrong track, by imagining a term <foreign>ni<supplied reason="lost">r</supplied>granthaputrajita</foreign>, whose <foreign>prima facie</foreign> meaning would have been ‘defeated by the sons of the Nirgrantha’, but which I considered to be an inverted <foreign>samāsa</foreign> (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Oberlies2003_01"/><citedRange unit="page">XLIV, 361</citedRange></bibl>), making it translatable as ‘by whom the sons of the Nirgrantha have been defeated’, which seemed like a potential designation of Buddhist or Ājīvika monks. My problems of interpretation were made worse by the presence of gaps in the first passage, by errors of spelling of certain terms or differences between the two passages, notably for the string that reads <foreign>cānyādyapiṇḍa-pāṇipātrikādi</foreign>- in emended form, and by the fact that the term <foreign>kṣamaṇa</foreign> (see below) is not found in any Sanskrit dictionaries.
                     <note>I only realized when most other pieces had fallen into place that the Prakrit equivalent <foreign>khamaṇa</foreign> is recorded in the <title>Illustrated Ardhamagadhi Dictionary</title>, vol. 2, p. 553.</note>
                     The process of resolving these problems started by reading the above data from Nāgavasu’s grant in conjunction with parallel passages from two previously published inscriptions:

                 <p>With regard to the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00034.xml">Jagadishpur plate</ref>, its editor D.C. Sircar unhesitatingly assumed that the monastic beneficiaries were Buddhists, and his great authority has led several subsequent scholars to accept this idea. <bibl><ptr target="bib:Schopen1990_01"/><citedRange unit="page">208-9</citedRange></bibl> (and <bibl><ptr target="bib:Schopen1990_01"/><citedRange unit="page">281</citedRange><citedRange unit="note">26</citedRange></bibl>) was more prudent and pointed to the significant parallels with the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00052.xml">Paharpur plate</ref> which certainly concern Jaina beneficiaries, adding the important observation: <q>The mere fact that it is not always easy to distinguish Buddhist and Jain inscriptions of this sort is […] in itself significant.</q>. We will see below some examples of overlap between the technical terminology of the two religions. But to return to the affiliation of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00034.xml">Jagadishpur plate</ref>, which is the least explicit of the three grants, the sum of the evidence presented in this section persuades me that its beneficiaries were Jaina monks as well. Their abbot is here called <foreign>śravaṇakācāryya</foreign>, probably an error for <foreign>śra<hi rend="bold">ma</hi>ṇakācāryya</foreign>.
</p>
                 <p>The <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00052.xml">Paharpur plate</ref> speaks of a <foreign>kāśika-pañca-stūpanikāyikani<supplied reason="lost">r</supplied>grantha-śramaṇācāryya</foreign>, and the reading <foreign>śramaṇa</foreign> here is secure. This word can indicate not only Jainas, but also Buddhist and Ājīvikas. For the former, see the SSanchi stone inscription of Candragupta II, year 93 Gupta Era, line 2 — <bibl><ptr target="bib:Bhandarkar1981_01"/><citedRange unit="page">250</citedRange></bibl>; for the latter, see the aforementioned plate dated 184 Gupta Era from Southeast Bengal, where we read (line 3–4, ed. <bibl><ptr target="bib:Furui2016_01"/></bibl>): <foreign>pūrvva-maṇḍala-jayanāṭane bhagavataś catur-mmukha-mūrtter mma<supplied reason="lost">ṇi</supplied>bhadrasyāyatana-m-ājīvaka-bhadanta-śramaṇa-saṁghāya</foreign> ‘for the sake of the community of respectable Ājīvika <foreign>śramaṇa</foreign>s at the abode of the venerable Maṇibhadra in four-faced image in Jayanāṭana of Pūrvamaṇḍala’. But the Jaina affiliation of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSBengalCharters00052.xml">Paharpur grant</ref> is beyond doubt, because the <foreign>pañcastūpanikāya</foreign> is a known name for a Jaina order
                     <note>See the paper by A.N.

                     and Jaina affiliation is implied also by the term <foreign>nirgrantha</foreign>.
                     <note>This is perhaps a fact too well known to require a bibliographic reference. Nevertheless, I may refer to <bibl><ptr target="bib:Schubring1978_01"/><citedRange unit="entry">§137</citedRange></bibl>.</note>
                     Incidentally, this word is consistently spelt <foreign>nigrantha</foreign> in the four occurrences in our corpus, perhaps because of subliminal influence from its Prakrit form <foreign>niggantha</foreign>.
</p>
                 <p>Now our new inscription contains the variant <foreign>kṣamaṇa</foreign>, which is known only in Jaina context, and to my knowledge only once elsewhere in South Asian epigraphy, viz. in the Vidiśā stone image inscriptions of the time of <foreign>mahārājādhirāja</foreign> Śrī Rāmagupta. The best preserved of these three copies of what is basically a single text, labeled A in Bhandarkar’s edition (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Bhandarkar1981_01"/><citedRange unit="page">231-4</citedRange></bibl>), reads as follows:

                 <p>In his recent article giving a useful overview of what is known about Jainism in North India during the Gupta period, <bibl><ptr target="bib:Dundas2014_01"/><citedRange unit="page">239</citedRange><citedRange unit="note">16</citedRange></bibl> affirms that <q>there is no doubt that the expression appended to these monks’s names is the same as the Prākrit honorific <foreign>khamāsamaṇa</foreign> (~ Sanskrit <foreign>kṣamāśramaṇa</foreign>), and has perhaps been misheard or misunderstood as being in a quasi-rhyming relationship with -śramaṇa by a scribe unfamiliar with Jain usage</q>. Although the new inscription may require rethinking of these matters, and the Vidiśā image inscriptions may have to be reinterpreted in such a way that <foreign>kṣamaṇācārya</foreign> stands as a unit, as it clearly does in our text, the main point of importance for my discussion is that the use of the term <foreign>kṣamaṇa</foreign> may be considered a clear indicator of the Jaina affiliation of the beneficiaries of Nāgavasu’s grant. The Vidiśā image inscriptions also contain another Jaina technical term that occurs in our inscription, namely <foreign>pāṇipātrika</foreign>, which has been elucidated by <bibl><ptr target="bib:Dundas2014_01"/><citedRange unit="page">239-40</citedRange><citedRange unit="note">18</citedRange></bibl>:
                    <q>The expression <foreign>pāṇipātrika</foreign> is a common epithet normally used of monks of the Digambara sect who differentiate themselves from the Śvetāmbaras who use alms bowls. However, the practice of using the hands as an alms bowl was also prescribed amongst the Śvetāmbaras for advanced monks following the <foreign>jinakalpa</foreign>, the ‘practice of the Jinas’, a more intense mode of renunciant life. As noted above, the honorific <foreign>kṣamāśramaṇa</foreign>, however represented in the inscription, seems to be characteristic of Śvetāmbara usage, and the conclusion must be that the monks in question were Śvetāmbaras, although the term may not have had a formally sectarian sense at this particular time</q>
                     I am unable to find any other occurrence of the term <foreign>anyādyapiṇḍa</foreign>, which is joined here with <foreign>pāṇipātrika</foreign>, and the reading is in both instances open to doubt. If I am correct in reading this term, it appears to give expression to the rule that Jaina monks “were required not to accept any food or water especially prepared for them” (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Balcerowicz2016_01"/><citedRange unit="page">110</citedRange></bibl>).
                     <note>For more details on this rule, see <bibl><ptr target="bib:Schubring1978_01"/><citedRange unit="page">272</citedRange><citedRange unit="entry"> §154</citedRange></bibl>:
                         <p><q>The alms, above all, must not be prepared in advance, neither for receivers of alms in general (<foreign>āhākamma</foreign>) nor for him personally who is expected to ask for them (<foreign>uddesiya</foreign>), no more than they may be sent for (<foreign>abhi-haḍa</foreign>) or bought (<foreign>kīya-gaḍa</foreign>) or set aside from one’s own meal (<foreign>ceiya</foreign> K. 2, 25-28, Dasā 2, 4, Nis. 10, 4, Āyār.

<p>Let me now try to explicate the sequence <foreign>nigrantha-putra-jitānāgatabhyāgatānānta-nivāsināñ ca</foreign> which is clearly preserved only on the reverse of the plate, and whose precise reading on the front can no longer be known, but which I have proposed to emend as follows: <foreign>ni<supplied reason="lost"><hi rend="bold">r</hi></supplied>grantha-putra-jitānāgat<hi rend="bold">ā</hi>bhyāgatānān ta<hi rend="bold">n</hi>-nivāsināñ ca</foreign>. The position of <foreign>ca</foreign> after the two genitive plural forms seems to be due to the author’s desire to establish a syntactic parallelism between, first, the long clause ending in <foreign>pravarttanāya</foreign> and, second, the long clause ending in <foreign>pratisaṁskārādyopayogāya</foreign>/<foreign>pratisaṁskārādyartthaṁ</foreign>. As regards the elements <foreign>anāgata</foreign>, <foreign>abhyāgata</foreign> and <foreign>tannivāsin</foreign>, it seems to me that the author was consciously playing with terminology that was used by his Buddhist contemporaries. Occurrences of these elements in Buddhist contexts have been discussed in a recent article by <bibl><ptr target="bib:Tournier2018_01"/><citedRange unit="page">67</citedRange></bibl>, with reference to 6th-century Sanskrit inscriptions from the Andhra region: “the <foreign>dvandva</foreign> <foreign>āgata-anāgata</foreign>, distinguishing between those who have arrived and will arrive in the future to reside at a given monastery, is uncommon in Indian inscriptions, and the term occurs almost exclusively in Pāli literature. Occurrences of the compound may thus be found in the Pāli Vinaya’s discussion of how residences should be dedicated to the Saṅgha, the locus classicus being the gift of the Jetavana by Anāthapiṇḍada.” In his discussion, he cites and translates the first three of the following epigraphical Sanskrit passages, the last two being added here by me:

                 <p>It will be noticed that none of these passages gives the precise combination <foreign>anāgatābhyāgata</foreign>, which indeed I am unable to find in any other context. I tentatively interpret the apparently unique expression <foreign>jitānāgatābhyāgata</foreign> as a reconfiguration of in origin Buddhist terms to express the Jaina tenet of eradication of past <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>abhyāgata</foreign></supplied> and future <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>anāgata</foreign></supplied> <foreign>karman</foreign>,
                     <note>Admittedly, I have so far identified no clearer expression of this idea than the following passages translated from the Āyāraṅgasutta (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Jacobi1884_02"/><citedRange unit="page">81</citedRange></bibl>):
                         <p><q>The sage, perceiving the double (karman), proclaims the incomparable activity, he, the knowing one; knowing the current of worldliness, the current of sinfulness, and the impulse, (15) Practising the sinless abstinence from killing, he did no acts, neither himself nor with the assistance of others; he to whom women were known as the causes of all sinful acts, he saw <supplied reason="explanation">the true state of the world</supplied>. (16)</q></p>
                         In his note on ‘double (<supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>karman</foreign></supplied>)’, Jacobi explains the meaning to be present and future, presumably based on the commentary. But in another passage, translated by <bibl><ptr target="bib:Jacobi1884_02"/><citedRange unit="page">32-3</citedRange></bibl>, we read: <q>There is no past thing, nor is there a future one; So opine the Tathagatas. He whose karman has ceased and conduct is right, who recognises the truth <supplied reason="explanation">stated above</supplied> and destroys sinfulness <supplied reason="explanation">thinks</supplied>: What is discontent and what is pleasure? not subject to either, one should live; Giving up all gaiety, circumspect and restrained, one should lead a religious life.</q></note>
                 although I cannot exclude other possibilities, among which the most likely one seems to be that the intended meaning of ni<supplied reason="subaudible">r</supplied>granthaputrajitānāgatābhyāgatānān was ‘of those who come in the present <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>abhyāgata</foreign></supplied> and in the future <supplied reason="explanation">anāgata</supplied>, the conquerors <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>jita</foreign></supplied> among the Nirgranthaputras’ and that the conjunction ca was intended to distinguish wandering ascetics from permanent residents <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>tannivāsinām</foreign></supplied>.
                 <note>Several of the elements from Nāgavasu’s grant analyzed so far find significant parallels in the epigraphic data from Jaina epigraphy in South India assembled in <bibl><ptr target="bib:Schmiedchen2018_02"/></bibl>, with regard to the purposes specified in such grants and the importance of teacher-disciple lines.</note></p>
                 <p>The designation <foreign>nirgranthaputra</foreign> is rather commonly used in Buddhist sources to designate Jainas or Ājīvikas, and it often occurs as a ‘surname’ for the heretic teacher Satyaka, or Saccaka Nigaṇṭhaputta in Pali (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Lamotte1960_01"/><citedRange unit="page">39</citedRange></bibl>). A long passage that is particularly relevant for our copper plate issued from Puṇḍravardhana is found in the Aśokāvadāna:
                     <q><foreign>tasmiṁś ca samaye puṇḍavardhananagare nirgranthopāsakena buddhapratimā nirgranthasya pādayor nipatitā citrārpitā | upāsakenāśokasya rājño niveditaṁ | śrutvā ca rājñābhihitaṁ śīghram ānīyatāṁ | tasyordhvaṁ yojanaṁ yakṣāḥ śr̥ṇvanti | adho yojanaṁ nāgāḥ | yāvat taṁ tatkṣaṇena yakṣair upanītaṁ | dr̥ṣṭvā ca rājñā ruṣitenābhihitam | puṇḍavardhane sarve ājīvikāḥ praghātayitavyāḥ | yāvad ekadivase ’ṣṭādaśasahasrāṇy ājīvikānāṁ praghātitāni |</foreign></q>
                     <q>In the meantime, in the city of Puṇḍavardhana, a lay follower of Nirgrantha Jñātiputra drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing down at the feet of his master. A Buddhist devotee reported this to King Aśoka, who then ordered the man arrested and brought to him immediately. The order was heard by the nāgas as far as a yojana underground, and by the yakṣas a yojana up in the air, and the latter instantly brought the heretic before the king. Upon seeing him, Aśoka flew into a fury and proclaimed: “All of the Ājīvikas in the whole of Puṇḍavardhana are to be put to death at once!” And on that day, eighteen thousand of them were executed.</q>

Balcerowicz who has cited the same passage in his recent book (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Balcerowicz2016_01"/><citedRange unit="page">270</citedRange></bibl>), and whose comments must be quoted here:
                     <q>The story is clearly fictitious and ahistorical for no images of the Buddha or the Jina are known to have existed at the time of Aśoka, and the account of the execution is similarly fictitious and ahistorical. Nevertheless, the legend may preserve a grain of truth, namely that Puṇḍravardhana had once been another centre of the Ājīvikas. Of note is that the passage is one of several examples when the term nirgrantha is erroneously used by the Buddhists to denote an Ājīvika.
</q>
                   Other evidence for such confusion on the part of Buddhist authors is added by Balcerowicz elsewhere in his book (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Balcerowicz2016_01"/><citedRange unit="page">278-9, 321</citedRange></bibl>). But he does not mention that the Chinese transmission in the same passage of the Aśokāvadāna, which I am able to access through the translation of <bibl><ptr target="bib:Przyluski1923_01"/><citedRange unit="page">278-9</citedRange></bibl>, uses characters corresponding to the term <foreign>nirgranthaputra</foreign> even where the Sanskrit transmission switches to ājīvikas. Since the Sanskrit text is available only in very late manuscripts, whereas the Chinese text translated by Przyluski dates to the 3rd century CE, there is some reason to take the Chinese version at face value and read the passage as evidence of Jaina rather than Ājīvika presence in Puṇḍravardhana in the first half of the first millennium CE.
</p>
                 <p>This can be corroborated with textual evidence from the Jaina tradition itself. For in Jacobi’s paraphrase of the Sthavirāvalī of Bhadrabāhu’s <title>Kalpasūtra</title> we read (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Jacobi1884_02"/><citedRange unit="page">288-9</citedRange></bibl>):<note>
                     I have standardized the transliteration system. The corresponding passage in the same scholar’s 1879 edition of the text is found on pp. 78–79.

                 <q>Ārya Bhadrabāhu of the Prācīna gotra, who had four disciples of the Kāśyapa gotra: a. Godāsa, founder of the Godāsa Gaṇa, which was divided into four Śākhās: α. The Tāmraliptikā Śākhā, β. The Koṭivarṣīyā Śākhā, γ. The <hi rend="bold">Puṇḍravardhanīyā</hi> Śākhā, and δ. The Dāsīkharbatikā Śākhā. b. Agnidatta, c. Gaṇadatta, d. Somadatta.</q>
                 We see here that Jaina’s were known to be settled in ancient Bengal not only at Puṇḍravardhana but also at such important known sites as Tāmralipti and Koṭivarṣa.<note>See the map, Pl. 1 <bibl><ptr target="bib:Griffiths2018_02"/><citedRange unit="page">17</citedRange></bibl>.</note></p>
