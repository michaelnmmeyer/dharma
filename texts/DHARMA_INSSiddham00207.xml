This inscription is digitally edited by Dániel Balogh from photographs of the original stone (taken at Mandsaur Museum in February 2017). The commentary makes reference to the edition of #Mirashi_1982-83 (M), the commentary of #Sircar_1984b (S), and the report of #Wakankar_1981 (W). Version of January 2019. Comments below are offered "as is" and do not represent a thoroughly researched or considered opinion.
--><!--
The size of the lacuna at the beginning of lines is 22 to 50 akṣaras according to #Mirashi_1982-83, and 24 to 38 according to #Sircar_1984b. I am convinced that this is impossible; on metrical grounds we must assume a much larger gap and posit about one additional verse per line compared to Mirashi's numbering of stanzas. Hence verse numbers in this edition diverge from Mirashi's.
--><ab><lb
n="1"/><gap reason="lost" precision="low" quantity="42" unit="character"/></ab><!--
L1. The lost text before the first partially extant verse probably included a maṅgala symbol or, as restored by Mirashi, by the word siddham. This may have been followed by a stanza in anuṣṭubh (32 characters) or upajāti (44 characters), probably also in honour of Viṣṇu.

L1. M reads **m atarkkita at the beginning. This may be a typo as pari is quite clear. The preceding character may have been py, in which case an instrumental ending in ā followed by api is a likely guess.

L1. The restoration jagataḥ puruṣottamāya is M's, who prints all of it as clearly read. It is a very plausible restoration, but a restoration nonetheless.
--><!--
L1. Punctuation signs transcribed as || are a double vertical, with a hook on the first one. Punctuation signs transcribed as | are horizontal dashes. Double verticals are quite consistent at verse ends; the short horizontal is not visible at every half-verse, but there do appear spaces there, and very faint dashes are not impossible.

L2. M conjectures that the name at the end of v4 (his v2) was yajñadevaḥ. This seems probable, but the vestige of the bottom part of the right edge of the preceding character does not seem to have the  slanted bottom stroke of y.

L2. M reads (or at least prints) tasmāttatejāyata. He may have intended tasmāt tato jāyata. My reading is certain.

L2. M reads svapne pi yasyaiva śama-pradhānañ, printing only pi ya as unclear, and the rest as clear. The restoration pi ya seems more than likely; however, paśama is clear and therefore the vowel of sy must be o.

<l n="d">ceto vikāran na gataṁ ka<unclear>dāc</unclear>iT||</l><!--
L2. dā of kadācit may be a correction over something else, perhaps tha (for kathaṁcit?). But the apparent superfluous lines may also be just damage.

L2. The halanta T is a small subscript character, probably with a line above it.

L3. The character before bhā seems to have an i mātrā (this is not noted by Mirashi), which also fits the svāgatā template. I am tempted to conjecturally restore bhuvi.

L3. Mirashi reads or prints caraṇa-vasrutalākṣo, which doesn't make sense. Neither M nor S give a translation, so they may not have understood this bit. I am quite certain of my reading, though the last character of the quarter looks, at a glance, more like mro or pro than su. I believe the strokes that look like a subscript r and an o mātrā are damage, and the centre of the s is weathered, but su is still the most plausible reading.
-->
<l n="d">bambhramīti giri-durgga-guhāsu||</l><!--
L3. M reads dugga, emending to durgga. The repha is clear, but its top is level with the tops of regular letters; the upper g is slightly lower than expected, and the lower g is of course subscript.

L3. M reads abhyudgamann asya. The character is not nn, compare e.g. vikāran na in l2 and nāgān nagendra in l8. Nt in ananta (l21) is not quite the same either but seems much more likely. Understand abhyudgamaṁ tasya.

L4. Mirashi does not read jagmuḥ at the beginning of l4. gmu is practically clear (for the subscript m, compare e.g. l2, tasmāt), and the top two prongs of the preceding ja are visible.
-->
<l n="d">trāsād dharer iva mr̥gā druta-śāba-yū<unclear>th</unclear>āḥ||</l><!--
L4. M reads druta-gā bayūdhāḥ and emends to druta-gā babhūvuḥ. My reading is certain. The cross-stroke of śā is faint but visible in the original stone. thā is malformed: it is open at the top and lacks a cross-stroke or dot in the centre (compare priyātithi in l8), but it is still definitely thā, not dhā (which should be pointed at the bottom). My reading feels a bit awkward (though far less so than Mirashi's), but I think it can be safely interpreted to mean "Upon seeing [whose, restore yasya or possibly tasya somewhere in ab] face, [his] enemies perished, as deer, whose young have fled in droves, [perish upon seeing] a lion's [face].
--></lg>
<lg n="10" met="upajāti">
<l n="a"><unclear>s</unclear>a vīryavān aulikari-pradhānañ</l><!--
L4. ry uses regular r with subscript y here and elsewhere.
--><!--
L4. Mirashi argues that the dynasty of this inscription cannot have been Aulikara. His chief argument is that here "sa" is the king of this dynasty (Bhāskaravarman in M's opinion, but since there is more text between here and Bh's name above, it could be his successor instead), and the Aulikari king is in the accusative, so our king must have "defeated a great king of the Aulikara family." I would find it very strange to see an enemy king praised as jitāriṣaḍvarggam and varaṁ nr̥pāṇām. Praising the defeated enemy is OK as a form of oblique self-praise, but this would involve praise of his prowess, not of his personal excellence. (Actually Mirashi himself, 1982-83:71, wonders why the Aulikari is described as jitāriṣaḍvargga if he was an enemy.) So I'm quite certain that the missing verb is not "defeated" but something else, e.g. "begat." Mirashi's other argument is that if these kings were Aulikaras, then "that family would have been glorified in the beginning [...] and not mentioned incidentally as is done here." But with my revision, we have much more lost text than M assumed; verses 2-3 could have devoted plenty of words to glorifying the dynasty before introducing (jña)deva. Also, Mirashi's reasoning seems faulty, since if they were _not_ Aulikaras, we would still expect praise for their dynasty at the beginning. Sircar believes that our king probably "propitiated the Aulikarin king as a vassal," which is also a possibility. Wakankar_1981:279 thinks Bhāskaravarman himself was an Aulikara, but this is based on his reading which is inaccurate (sa vīryavān aulikarī pradhāna jitāriṣaḍvargya upendravīra).
-->
<l n="b">jitāri-ṣaḍ-varggam upendra-vīryaM</l><!--
L4. M reads vīryaḥ. The halanta M is damaged but quite certain in the stone and the accusative fits the semantics better since we have vīryavān in the nominative in pāda a. The M also explains why there is no punctuation mark here.
-->
<l n="c">varaṁ nr̥pāṇām ajitā<lb

</lg>
<lg n="11" met="uncertain"><!--
L4. Based on the estimated length of the lacuna and the prosodic context, the metre of the lost verse was probably either upajāti (44 syllables) or mālabhāriṇī (46 syllables).
-->
<l n="a"><gap reason="lost" precision="low" quantity="11" unit="character"/></l>

<lg n="12" met="mālabhāriṇī"><!--
L5. M labels v12 and 13 (his 8 and 9) as udgatā, which seems to be wrong; udgatā is a viṣama metre while this verse is an ardhasama, namely mālabhāriṇī; what's left of the next verse also fits this template. M furthermore gives the prosody of the lacuna in 13a as something that is neither udgatā nor mālabhāriṇī.
-->
<l n="a"><seg met="--+--+"><gap reason="lost" quantity="6" unit="character"/></seg> <supplied reason="lost">u</supplied>dāra-vr̥ttān</l><!--
L5. I believe vr̥ttān must be understood to stand for vr̥ttāṁ, singular feminine accusative, not masculine plural. There have been several instances above of using nasal consonants instead of anusvāra. There are some vestiges of the top right part of a character before dā, which permit an m, and I think another feminine accusative may have been there. But a compound is not out of the question either.
-->
<l n="b">dayitāṁ rūpa-guṇānvayair a<unclear>h</unclear>ī<unclear>n</unclear>āM</l><!--
L5. M prints vayitāṁ instead of dayitāṁ, apparently a typo (or did he read and construe udāra+vr̥tta+anvayitām?). In any case, nda is clear, and a word straddling the pāda boundary is improbable. Sircar specifically mentions dayitā as a word of the text. However, Wakankar reads vr̥ttābhyāryatāṁ kūpa-guṇānvayair, sic, and thinks the king's merits are compared to a well, perhaps because a well was constructed to commemorate the victory. The character rū does look a bit like kka or kū, but rū must be the correct reading.
--><!--
L5. M reads (or prints) rūpaguṇānvayai rahitāM, which does not make sense and is also unmetrical. Sircar's commentary talks of "the vanquisher of enemies [...] happy in receiving a suitable dayitā or wife"; Mirashi does not even give a summary - probably neither of them tried to interpret this bit. My reading is quite certain.
--><!--
L5. The halanta m is a small subscript character with a line above, which seems to double as punctuation.
-->
<l n="c">jahr̥ṣe jita-sarvva-śattru-pakṣo</l><!--

L6. M only reads ti at the beginning of the line, but Wakankar_1981:279 correctly reports "gati kumāravarmma-nāmā". Mirashi may have ignored the clear ga in order to fit this fragment to the mālabhāriṇī metre, which the syllable ga rules out.

Wakankar himself thinks so. Unfortunately most of the context is lost, and vinivr̥tta is open to several interpretations. In order of my decreasing preference: the substrate of his well-being was 1: removed from him by the ferocity of barbarians (dasyūnāṁ pratāpena vinivr̥ttaḥ apagataḥ sukhāśrayo yasya saḥ) / 2: liberated from the ferocity of barbarians (dasyūnāṁ pratāpād vinivr̥ttaḥ muktaḥ...) / 3: returned to him thanks to the ferocity of barbarians (dasyūnāṁ pratāpena vinivr̥ttaḥ punaḥ prāptaḥ ...). 1 seems to sit well with vyāmugdha-etc, but one would expect a transitive or causative verb, not an intransitive one.

L13. M says nothing about kalkali. Sircar's commentary says "comparable to the Kālkali king" without further details. The reading is ka, not kā. According to MW, kalkala is the name of a people in the Viṣṇupurāṇa (PWG: the ref is VP 193). There is also a neuter noun kalkana meaning meanness, wickedness. There is an adjective akalkala, apparently a variant of akalkana, meaning not deceitful, honourable. There is an anusvāra-like dot after ka, and a sort of kākapāda sign like ˇ below the baseline between ka and lka. The dot may well be damage (there are many similar ones, though most seem shallower), but the wedge was almost certainly carved. This dot is probably what Sircar saw as an ā, but it is definitely not connected to k. The wedge is above vo in nijaniketamivopanītā in the following line but is less likely to belong to that line. Can kalkali be a variant of Kalki? Or do we assume a hapax kalkalin, from kalkala, meaning deceitful/wicked, and take this to mean that he was like a moon compared to the other kings who are all mean?

L18. M's reading for the beginning of l18 is dhārṇṇavo cīkarat. Sircar read the name as bhogārṇṇavo, which is correct (bhāgārṇṇavo may be possible but doesn't sound plausible).

L19. M reads only from kāriṇi. I'm quite certain of dvi, though part of d is damaged, and of the subscript v, only the right-hand vertical survives, with a hint of an angle at the bottom. (ddhi is possible but doesn't seem to fit the context) The vestigial ā mātrā before it is faint but very likely.
--><!--
L19. M prints sarvvalaḥ, probably a typo. The word is followed by a clear halfverse mark, which M does not print.
--><!--
L19. Sircar's understanding of the stanza is that "the king (Kumāravarman) himself placed some one greatly devoted to himself (i.e. Bhogārṇava) who was at first the officer to look after the manufacture of articles and did his job satisfactorily, in charge of dealing with the removal of the bad name attached possibly to Daśapura as a city infested by thieves and robbers." I have no idea where his officer to look after manufacture of articles comes from. Did he read the beginning of the line as [*a]dhikāriṇi? Manufacturing is still in a fog.

L19. M reads yuktaṁ for yatnaṁ. What looks a bit like an u attached to dy is in fact part of the subscript n in tna.

				<ab><gap reason="lost" precision="low" quantity="92" unit="character"/></ab><!--
L19. On the basis of the estimated size of the lacuna (ca. 92 characters in addition to the missing beginning of v49) I assume a pair of 11-syllable stanzas lost here. Other alternatives are possible, such a single very long stanza (e.g. sragdharā), or a combination of metres e.g. anuṣṭubh and vasantatilakā. Marked up as an anonymous block.

L20. Before sa at the beginning of the extant text, ka is damaged but probable (ra is also possible); the preceding character almost certainly has a subscript y and probably a triangular body, most likely v or dh.

L20. M prints an original punctuation mark after sattamena, but this is a mistake.
-->
<l n="b">bhogārṇṇava-priyatayābhisamīkṣya pāttraM</l><!--
L20. M actually prints bhogīrṇṇava and priyatuyā, both must be typos. also pātraṁ, though pāttram is clear. M may have wanted an anusvāra because he took this to be pāda c of a verse.
-->
<l n="c">svarggaika-deśa Iva nettra-mano-<supplied reason="subaudible">’</supplied>nu<unclear>kū</unclear>lo</l><!--
L20. M reads svargge kaṭāśa Iva temamanena jāle (sic) and prints an original double daṇḍa after his jāle. My reading is certain.

L20. M reads datte.
--><!--
L20. M reads haritā at the end of the line. The last character is clearly va; the preceding one is damaged but looks like d, with traces of an e mātrā. Sircar also read Harideva. (Could this be tied to Harideva of the Tumain inscription? Probably not.)
--></lg><!--
L20. Sircar believes that v49 (his v30-31) says Bhogārṇava was "favoured by the king by the creation of the grant of a village or a group of villages for Harideva who was very probably the priest of Bhogārṇava's temple. I don't know where he sees this.
--><ab><gap reason="lost" precision="low" quantity="90" unit="character"/></ab><!--
L18. The size of the lacuna must again be about 90 characters in addition to what is missing from the beginning of v50 and the end of v49. Any combination of prose, varṇavr̥tta and mātrāvr̥tta is possible so I mark it up as an anonymous block.
--><lg n="48" met="āryā"><!--
L21. M identifies the metre as upagīti, which is not possible with his reading bhavyā ca nannatanayena. The whole of the second half and what remains of the first half corresponds to āryā.

<l n="ab"><gap reason="lost" precision="low" quantity="10" unit="character"/> <unclear>ṣ</unclear><unclear cert="low">ṭ</unclear>ār<unclear>th</unclear>ā bhartry-ananta-tanayena|</l><!--
L21. M's reading is bhavyā ca nanna-tanayena, which is impossible. According to Sircar's summary of the closing stanza, "the pūrvā was composed by Lakṣmaṇagupta, son of Bhartr̥ (Bhaṭṭi)-Ananta out of his love for the king." He probably read bhartryananta correctly, but standardised it for his summary. The reading ṣṭārthā is quite certain, though the ṭ is eroded. If correct, this would have been preceded by a single syllable and a caesura before that, e.g. spaṣṭārthā.
--><!--
L21. The punctuation after tanayena is strange: there is both a dash and a vertical, forming the top and right side of a box. One or the other of the strokes may be damage. I think the dash is probably engraved. The space after it (assuming the vertical stroke is a scratch) is slightly larger than after other dash punctuation marks.
