This inscription is digitally edited by Dániel Balogh from photographs of the original stone (taken at Mandsaur Museum in February 2017). The commentary makes reference to the edition of #Mirashi_1982-83 (M), the commentary of #Sircar_1984b (S), and the report of #Wakankar_1981 (W). Version of January 2019. Comments below are offered "as is" and do not represent a thoroughly researched or considered opinion.

        <!--
The size of the lacuna at the beginning of lines is 22 to 50 akṣaras according to #Mirashi_1982-83, and 24 to 38 according to #Sircar_1984b. I am convinced that this is impossible; on metrical grounds we must assume a much larger gap and posit about one additional verse per line compared to Mirashi's numbering of stanzas. Hence verse numbers in this edition diverge from Mirashi's.

My reading feels a bit awkward (though far less so than Mirashi's), but I think it can be safely interpreted to mean "Upon seeing [whose, restore yasya or possibly tasya somewhere in ab] face, [his] enemies perished, as deer, whose young have fled in droves, [perish upon seeing] a lion's [face].

          <!--
L4. Mirashi argues that the dynasty of this inscription cannot have been Aulikara. His chief argument is that here "sa" is the king of this dynasty (Bhāskaravarman in M's opinion, but since there is more text between here and Bh's name above, it could be his successor instead), and the Aulikari king is in the accusative, so our king must have "defeated a great king of the Aulikara family." I would find it very strange to see an enemy king praised as jitāriṣaḍvarggam and varaṁ nr̥pāṇām. Praising the defeated enemy is OK as a form of oblique self-praise, but this would involve praise of his prowess, not of his personal excellence. (Actually Mirashi himself, 1982-83:71, wonders why the Aulikari is described as jitāriṣaḍvargga if he was an enemy.) So I'm quite certain that the missing verb is not "defeated" but something else, e.g. "begat." Mirashi's other argument is that if these kings were Aulikaras, then "that family would have been glorified in the beginning [...] and not mentioned incidentally as is done here." But with my revision, we have much more lost text than M assumed; verses 2-3 could have devoted plenty of words to glorifying the dynasty before introducing (jña)deva. Also, Mirashi's reasoning seems faulty, since if they were _not_ Aulikaras, we would still expect praise for their dynasty at the beginning. Sircar believes that our king probably "propitiated the Aulikarin king as a vassal," which is also a possibility. Wakankar_1981:279 thinks Bhāskaravarman himself was an Aulikara, but this is based on his reading which is inaccurate (sa vīryavān aulikarī pradhāna jitāriṣaḍvargya upendravīra).

However, Wakankar reads vr̥ttābhyāryatāṁ kūpa-guṇānvayair, sic, and thinks the king's merits are compared to a well, perhaps because a well was constructed to commemorate the victory. The character rū does look a bit like kka or kū, but rū must be the correct reading.

In order of my decreasing preference: the substrate of his well-being was 1: removed from him by the ferocity of barbarians (dasyūnāṁ pratāpena vinivr̥ttaḥ apagataḥ sukhāśrayo yasya saḥ) / 2: liberated from the ferocity of barbarians (dasyūnāṁ pratāpād vinivr̥ttaḥ muktaḥ...) / 3: returned to him thanks to the ferocity of barbarians (dasyūnāṁ pratāpena vinivr̥ttaḥ punaḥ prāptaḥ ...). 1 seems to sit well with vyāmugdha-etc, but one would expect a transitive or causative verb, not an intransitive one.

L13. M says nothing about kalkali. Sircar's commentary says "comparable to the Kālkali king" without further details. The reading is ka, not kā. According to MW, kalkala is the name of a people in the Viṣṇupurāṇa (PWG: the ref is VP 193). There is also a neuter noun kalkana meaning meanness, wickedness. There is an adjective akalkala, apparently a variant of akalkana, meaning not deceitful, honourable. There is an anusvāra-like dot after ka, and a sort of kākapāda sign like ˇ below the baseline between ka and lka. The dot may well be damage (there are many similar ones, though most seem shallower), but the wedge was almost certainly carved. This dot is probably what Sircar saw as an ā, but it is definitely not connected to k. The wedge is above vo in nijaniketamivopanītā in the following line but is less likely to belong to that line. Can kalkali be a variant of Kalki? Or do we assume a hapax kalkalin, from kalkala, meaning deceitful/wicked, and take this to mean that he was like a moon compared to the other kings who are all mean?

L19. M prints sarvvalaḥ, probably a typo. The word is followed by a clear halfverse mark, which M does not print.

L19. Sircar's understanding of the stanza is that "the king (Kumāravarman) himself placed some one greatly devoted to himself (i.e. Bhogārṇava) who was at first the officer to look after the manufacture of articles and did his job satisfactorily, in charge of dealing with the removal of the bad name attached possibly to Daśapura as a city infested by thieves and robbers." I have no idea where his officer to look after manufacture of articles comes from. Did he read the beginning of the line as [*a]dhikāriṇi? Manufacturing is still in a fog.

According to Sircar's summary of the closing stanza, "the pūrvā was composed by Lakṣmaṇagupta, son of Bhartr̥ (Bhaṭṭi)-Ananta out of his love for the king." He probably read bhartryananta correctly, but standardised it for his summary. The reading ṣṭārthā is quite certain, though the ṭ is eroded. If correct, this would have been preceded by a single syllable and a caesura before that, e.g. spaṣṭārthā.
-->
          <!--
L21. The punctuation after tanayena is strange: there is both a dash and a vertical, forming the top and right side of a box. One or the other of the strokes may be damage. I think the dash is probably engraved. The space after it (assuming the vertical stroke is a scratch) is slightly larger than after other dash punctuation marks.
