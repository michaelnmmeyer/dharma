For the 2 or 3 characters lost at the beginning, Melzer tentatively restores siddham. I concur wholeheartedly. 
-->
          <!-- 
Melzer says the double daṇḍa at this point is clearer on the back face. 
-->
          <!-- 
Daśabala is followed by one or two characters completely lost, and the unidentiable bottom part of a presumable ligature. Melzer offers the restoration daśabala-balī in her textual notes but does not add it to her reconstructed text. The reconstruction svā is my tentative guess. 
-->
          <!-- 
Melzer is very cautious about the restoration vacanaḥ, mentioning it only in her textual notes.

The restoration tribhuvana is Melzer's. She seems to say that the n of the ligature is clear but the t is illegible. (The i is lost to damage at the top edge.) 
-->
          <!-- 
I don't know how clearly Melzer could see vr̥t in the original, but I don't like it semantically. My gut says kr̥t or perhaps hr̥t would be more likely. 
-->
          <!-- 
Melzer points out that the line ends about 2 characters earlier than the subsequent lines, probably because the top right of the scroll was rounded off, just like the bottom left (which is broken off, but there is e.g. no text lost from the beginning of l52, which shows that the last couple of lines began to the right of earlier lines). If the top left was also rounded off, then there may not have been room for siddham at the start - maybe just a maṅgala symbol?

The na at the beginning of l3 is Melzer's restoration; she also restores gu at the end of the lacuna, but I have doubts about this. The second half (or at least the last quarter) of the verse must be about the saṁgha (as Melzer herself says in her translation), but I'd expect a noun somewhere that actually means saṁgha, and all we have now is a string of qualifiers for it. My conjecture would be sādhakagaṇaḥ, but I don't know if Melzer's reading of ṇa before gaṇaḥ could be overruled. One syllable remains to be accounted for, which could be a verbal root (inflected in the nominative or in compound) to the effect that this congregation knows or follows the words of the sage. Melzer, on the other hand, offers munivacana-dhārī guṇa-gaṇaḥ as a tentative restoration. 
--><!-- 
The punctuation mark is a double vertical which, as Melzer_2006:253 observes in her detailed description of the punctuation in this inscription, is used mostly to mark the ends of verses.

The restorations at the beginnings of lines 4-14 are Melzer's, following Goshima's text of the Śrīmatī-brāhmaṇī-paripr̥cchā (reconstructed from Tibetan translation). See Melzer_2006:253-254 for details. 
--><!-- 
The superfluous punctuation after mahatā seems to be a centredot. 
--><!-- 
The t at the beginning of line 6 is subscript, but full size. Melzer says this is "For unknown reasons"; perhaps there was already a crack at the edge here even before the engraving? This is the point from which the top left corner is broken off (including the presumed e mātrā of this t along with the beginnings of all previous lines) . 
--><!-- 
The halanta character at the end of l6 is reduced subscript form with a dot above it. 
--><!-- 
The punctuation at the end of l6 is a dot, vertically aligned with the tops of characters. 
--><!-- 
In l9, Melzer's diplomatic edition prints prasadanīyaṁ, while her reconstructed text reads prasādanīyaṁ. Since she usually attaches footnotes to corrections, this may be a typo in the diplomatic edition. My photo is very unclear, but from it it seems possible, and from Melzer's eye copy even likely, that we have sā here, with some damage in the top horizontal attaching the ā mātrā to the stem. 
--><!-- 
The anusvāra of dāntaṁ in l10 is supplied by Melzer. It seems from the photo that there is a small hole in the copper here, so I mark it up as lost and supplied. 
--><!-- 
For the restoration bhāsamānam in l12, Melzer notes that some other synonym may also be possible. 
--><!-- 
Melzer notes that there may be a punctuation mark after prasannaṁ (and before the unclear pra) at the end of l12. 
--><!-- 
The restoration śirasā vanditvā in l13 is again uncertain, says Melzer; the Tibetan has no equivalent of śirasā. 
--></p>

          <gap precision="low" quantity="2" reason="lost" unit="line"/>
          <!-- 
Melzer hypothesises two lost lines but does not attempt to restore them since there is no exact parallel available. Based on the Tibetan, the lost text ran along the lines of svāgataṁ bhagavan/bhagavate| niṣīdatu bhagavān prajñapta evāsana iti| Given that there is no reliable restoration, I do not know why Melzer is certain that two full lines have been lost here. A single full line, or possibly even no full lost line at all, seems sufficient.

The characters ganna at the end of B1 are outside the margin (Melzer notes this only for nna). Given the restored text, the reason is probably eyeskip: bhagaryāṁ was inscribed instead of bhagavannagaryāṁ and subsequently partially corrected. A va may also have been inserted above this line - that part of the sheet is now lost. 
--><!-- 
The punctuation after iti in B2 is a dot, again at about the height of the headline. [Hereafter I will not comment on prose sentence ends marked with a dot - I'll just transcribe them as daṇḍas.]

Melzer prints aṣṭhāṣaṣṭi in both her diplomatic and reconstructed edition. Her eye copy clearly has ṣṭhā, and the photo seems to confirm this; the subscript character does not seem to be the same as that in ṣṭi immediately afterward. Nevertheless I give the engraver the benefit of doubt and transcribe aṣ(ṭ)āṣaṣṭi.

34. For Tālagāna, re. Melzer's and Bakker's thoughts, there may be one more clue. A people called talagānas are mentioned (near hūṇas) in the purāṇic geography, see Kirfel in the Huna corpus, lampākās talagānāś ca. It may be a good idea to trace other occurrences of this name.

Melzer observes that the first character of l35 is a ligature. My photo shows nothing discernible; Melzer's eye copy looks rather like Ā. Could this be rthi, for pārthivena? Can't tell, without a better photo.

In B20 Melzer reads ho#1#g(a)yena. The photo is unclear as usual, but the reading is far from certain, so I've added a bit more unclear markup. The first character does not look like ho and it has some bits extending downwards; could it be sto? A diagonal crack runs through the next character, if there was a character at all; no engraving is discernible on the photo. If there is a missing character here, it would have been pretty narrow. The next character after that looks like la, not ga on the photo.

I adopt Melzer's reading of sspaṣṭhīkr̥, which she emends to spaṣṭīkr̥, which in turn she takes to stand metri causa for spaṣṭīkr̥t and to mean, probably, sphaṭika, "crystal." I think the correct reading may in fact be ssphāṣṭikya. I too would delete the extra s, and take sphāṣṭikya as a hyper-Sanskritised form of sphāṭikya, "something made of crystal."

I adopt Melzer's reading of ni(?rū)ḍha. She actually prints the character rū as illegible and supplied, but there is a pretty strongly visible character here, and it doesn't look like rū. She translates the compound "raised high by parasols and possessing railings", noting that one would expect udāra as an adjective to chatra and not as an adverb to nirūḍha. She also offers the alternative translation "bearing parasols and tall (udāranirūḍha) railings". I offer two more alternative interpretations based on different readings. If we read nigūḍha instead of nirūḍha, which seems quite possible from the photo but maybe not from the original, then we could translate "bearing railings covered by excellent parasols" (taking chatrodāra as a reversed karmadhāraya or as "the most excellent of parasols"), which seems to make sense if vedikā is interpreted as the little railing at the top of a stūpa, just below the parasol. The other would be to read nibaddha, which seems less likely from the photo, and translate "magnificent on account of their parasols and bearing [well-]joined railings". All considered, I think nigūḍha is good.

She only notes in passing that another interpretation is also possible, "May that country, in which this basis for understanding, my body, has grown in purity, remain happy..."

Melzer's reading and emendation is kula-bala-va[#ya]-vai(rī) {{!(v)!}{=c=}}(a) yo yāntu nāśa(M), but as she herself admits, it's a bit of a stretch to take vaya as metri causa for vayo, emend va to ca and construe yāntu with a singular subject. I should add to this that what's visible of the character between va and vai does not look like ya at all. I think the key to this line would be to read the bit before yāntu as a plural nominative of an i-stem, and I believe the correct reading is ītayo yāntu nāśaM. The character I read as ta does look like va, but from the photo, ta may also be possible with a bit of a scratch underneath. To carry on, I think ītayo is preceded by a plural instrumental, just as in the second line we have vardhyantām and a plural instrumental. "May the heroes of renunciation prosper/be increased with respect to family, strength and X; may calamities be annihilated." Now what could X be? My best guess is vinaya. So my reading is: r̥ddhyantāṁ tyāga-śūrāḥ kula-bala-v[#i](nay)air ī(ta)yo yāntu nāśa(M). This also matches the metrical segmentation of the caesurae.

The initial characters of line B37 are extant but very badly damaged (the first character may be completely lost to the broken-off corner). The position of śa/ru in the metrical formula is not certain; it could well be one syllable earlier.

For line B38, I can't even tell where the text is. From Melzer's eye copy it appears to have been scrawled near the bottom right corner (below the jā of dātr̥-rājā if that is the correct reading), where the eye copy shows what looks like "ma" (not transcribed in Melzer's edition and indiscernible in the photo, so I'm not including it in my edition either), then some empty space, then the anusvāra with which Melzer's edition ends.
