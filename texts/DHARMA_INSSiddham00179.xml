          <!-- 
L2. For v2d, B reads kārāpakārāstanayā py(u)dārāḥ, suggestiong emendation to nayāf pyudārāḥ (sic) or nayā hyudārāḥ. He translates "the best of communities, placed in which, as in a beautiful vessel, even those who have sinned by committing murder, become exalted", noting, "The phrase kārāpakārāstanayāḥ is very ambiguous, as it may be taken as one compound, consisting of kārāpakāra and astanaya, or as two words, kārāpakārāḥ and tanayāḥ, and as kāra may be interpreted "effort," or "a Yati," or "murder." ... The poet, no doubt, intended to puzzle the reader." His explanation goes on. Mirashi also notes that "This verse has puzzled previous editors" and "The sense of the second half of this verse is somewhat obscure." He reads kārāpakā(rā)stana(yā) hyudārāḥ and translates "the best among all communities, having done service to which, a worthy recipient, the sons (of men) become exalted." He notes that "The akṣara before dā is certainly hyu, and the verbal form bhavanti shows that the subject must be in the plural. So tanayā hyudārāḥ must be the intended reading." In a note attached to his translation he says "Kāra seems to be used herein(sic) the same sense as in Pali, viz. a deed, service, act of mercy or worship, homage. Kārāpakāra is apparently used here in the same sense as Kārakāraka 'one who performs a religious duty or service'." (citing Rhys Davids on this) He also points to the word kārā used in #IN00178:17. I find both interpretations forced and unconvincing. I think the solution is to read ssu instead of sta, and to interpret this bit to mean something like "[the saṁgha] in which lofty good doctrines that dispel (apakāra) actions (kāra) [that is, the results of action] are placed in [i.e. taught to] worthy vessels [i.e. students].

L3. B reads puṇyakīrttirttir vaṁśo. Indraji, according to Mirashi, read rvvaśo. Mirashi reads puṇyakīrttir vva(ṅ)śo, noting that 1. "v seems to have been repeated after r" and 2. "ś appears much below the line so that there is sufficient space for the superscript ... ṅ, though it is not quite certain here". I'm not sure what he means by 1, there does seem to be a va (or rva or vi) between kī and rtti. As for 2, ṅś is clear in Indraji's rubbing, though the vowel looks like e, not o. Judging from Indraji's rubbing, the string ṇyakīrttirvva seems to be a correction written over a longer and partially erased string, of which only the v is recognisable. Although, since we have similar problems in subsequent lines in this same area, perhaps these are just faults of the rock surface, which the writing had accommodated?

Mirashi feels "the next akshara also ... has a similar ī-mark". There may also be correction here; the supposed tī occupies the space of at least two characters and has a lot of random squiggles around it. The only part where I see something like an ī mātrā in Indraji's facsimile is below the tha of l4; before it, there may simply be some space on account of prā hanging down.

L5. The halanta N at the end of v5b seems no different from a regular na. It seems to be followed by a centredot, the like of which is not noticeable at other half-verse points, so it is probably not punctuation - can this be a virāma sign?

I think °nāmā simply agrees with vasatir. M also says their abode was called vallūra (and they were named after it), rejecting B's emendation. I'm not sure why M wants to read nāmnā; possibly this is a typo in his text and he actually did want to read nāmā, like I do.
