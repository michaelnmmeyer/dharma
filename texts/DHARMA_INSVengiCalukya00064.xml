            <note>NLR only observes that the text from <foreign>aṣṭottara</foreign> is half an <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> stanza. I prefer to assume that we are dealing with a full stanza here, though it is possible that the first hemistich has indeed been converted into prose. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bezvāḍa plates of Bhīma I</ref>, which contains a practically identical genealogy, has corrupt prose here: <foreign>tat-suto vijayādityaḥ catvāriṁśat samaḥ</foreign>. Other grants of the dynasty describe the length of Vijayāditya II's reign in <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> (though not juxtaposed to the extant hemistich here) as <foreign>catvāriṁśat samāṣṭabhiḥ</foreign> or <foreign>catvāriṁśat samās samaḥ</foreign>. There is no way to determine whether a reign of forty or forty-eight years was assigned here. The last character in line 7 may perhaps be <foreign>T</foreign> or <foreign>tsa</foreign> rather than <foreign>ta</foreign>.

            <note>The meaning of the lost text was certainly as restored by NLR, but the words may have been different. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00024.xml">Bezvāḍa plates of Bhīma I</ref> have <foreign>samaḥ tan-nandano</foreign> here.</note>

            <note>I assume that NLR could read the text he prints as clear and could estimate the number of lost characters with some precision, in which case his restoration is perfectly plausible. But if he was guessing where he admits no doubt, then the text could have run somewhat differently.

            <note>At the end of line 10 I see nothing recognisable beyond <foreign>bhū</foreign>, but I assume that NLR's <foreign>bhu</foreign> is based on vestiges.

            <note>The reading is highly doubtful. This was almost certainly a stanza in the original. NLR suggests that its metre may have been <foreign>āryā</foreign>, but if his reading is largely correct, then this is prosodically impossible. Given the lengths of adjacent lines (29 characters each in lines 14 and 15; 31 in line 18), the total length of the stanza would have been about 40 characters, with about 2 in the first lacuna and about 13 in the second. It may perhaps have been in <foreign>viyoginī</foreign> (42 characters total), but this too is only possible if NLR's reading is substantially incorrect.</note>

            <note>NLR prints eight dots for the first lacuna and two for the second.

        <p>This set of plates is a palimpsest, with two plates of an Eastern Cālukya grant re-utilised for a Vijayanagar grant (edited in the same article). Only plates 2 and 3 of the original grant are preserved, with the genealogy extant from Jayasiṁha I onward. The pages of the original grant are not in the same order as those of the later one, so that EC page 2r is Vijayanagar 2r; EC 2v = V 2v; EC 3r = V 1r and EC 3v = V 1v. At least one, probably two additional plates at the end of the EC grant are also lost. The two remaining plates have been re-cut into the shape of a typical Vijayanagar grant, causing the loss of some characters at the corners. The plates, when found, were bound by a ring without a seal.</p>
        <p>Stanza 3 (<foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign>) has a caesura in the middle of a word in <foreign>pāda</foreign> b. If NLR reads the text correctly, then <foreign>pāda</foreign> c of stanza 4 (<foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign>) has muta cum liquida licence, a caesura in the middle of a word (before a suffix), and enjambement (at a compound boundary) from this <foreign>pāda</foreign> to the next.</p>

The present edition by Dániel Balogh is based on a collation of Lakshminarayan Rao's edition with his visual aids where available. The photos are rather poor, wholly illegible in the areas overwritten by the later grant and barely or not at all legible outside the palimpsest. I thus follow Lakshminarayan Rao unless otherwise noted, and I adopt NLR's indications of unclear text rather than marking up as unclear everything that is not clearly legible in the printed photos.</p>
