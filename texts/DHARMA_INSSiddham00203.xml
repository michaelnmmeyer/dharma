L1. Siddham is inline. The halanta M is a small subscript character with a line above it; it has clear serifs on both arms.

          <l n="a">devī jayaty asura-dāraṇa-tīkṣṇa-śūlā|</l>
          <!--
L1. Sircar reads a superfluous visarga between śūlā and the punctuation mark. Though pādas c and d of the stanza end with superfluous visargas, this is not the case here; the two mi-nuscule and shallow dots above and below the ā mātrā do not resemble a proper visarga, compare roṣāḥ in l2.
-->
          <!--
L1. The punctuation mark is a horizontal dash at headline height, slightly curved (dipping at the centre).

          <!--
L1. Sircar notes that there may be a superfluous anusvāra above the ta of āsthita, but it may also be just a flaw in the stone. Similar occurrences later on are not noted by Sircar. The dot is clear and quite deep in the stone, but it is high above the character so it is probably not  part of the writing.
-->
          <!--
L1. The punctuation mark at the end of the line is a single horizontal, placed low, almost at baseline level.

          <!--
L3. Svākya was suggested to Sircar by Chhabra; Sircar notes it must be derived from svaka and understood as svakīya. SI marks svā as unclear, but the reading is unambiguous in the stone in spite of some damage and the strangeness of the word.
-->
          <!--
L3. Note the metrical licence in treating sv, pr and sn as single consonants. Sircar's opinion of the skill of the poet is worth quoting: "the author's style is weak ... his knowledge of the Sanskrit language and skill in handling the metres were both very poor. ... numerous ... attempts of a desperate and ludicrous nature to save the metre at the cost of grammar."
-->
          <!--
L3. Sircar prints no original punctuation at the end of v2, but there is a clear horizontal stroke at headline height.

L4. Sircar_1953-54b:122 reports Ojha assuming that Gaura was their clan name (he also read gaura instead of gauri in l14 and could not read the dynastic name māṇavāyaṇi). Sircar prefers to understand that the compound vaṁśa-gaura means "a person who purified his family by virtuous acts or was himself illustrious owing to his birth in the family in question."

L5. Sircar reads grīmān and the cross-stroke is invisible in the rubbing, but it is quite clear, though faint (narrow and shallow) in the stone.
-->
          <!--
L5. gha is strangely shaped, drawn as two curves (like an inverted lowercase m) instead of a straight bottom and three prongs. It is definitely gha, as read by Sircar.
-->
          <!--
L5. Sircar reads vakṣaḥ and emends; I think the ā mātrā is there, though quite small.

          <!--
L5. The rare halanta K is a reduced but fully formed ka, subscript with a line above.
-->
          <!--
L5. p in fact looks like b or pā and may be a correction from either of these. (Compare sūnur in l6.) The u mātrā is also unclear; Sircar reads it as pū an emends. It is completely different from the mātrā of pū in pūrṇṇendu, l6, as well as from that in pūrvvā, l14 (nor are these latter two alike). I accept the present one as an awkward u, though the vowel mark in yat puṇyaṁ, l14, is again unlike any of the above.

L5. Sircar suggests emending mūrddhni to mūrddha in cpd, which does make sense. The construction is still very awkward.
-->
          <!--
L5. I follow Sircar's reading of ghaṭi and emendation to ghaṭā. The vowel mark is definitely a full circle, identical to that of the following bhi, so it is very unlikely that this is an unusual way of attaching ā to ṭ.

L6. Sircar notes that sū also has a superfluous ā mātrā. This actually connects the end of the ū mātrā to the headmark and may be a correction from ā to ū, or it may be a calligraphic design. Compare punya in l5 above.

L6. Sircar prints rājyavarddhaṇa in bold and even suggests emending to °no in spite of this being unmetrical (as he notes). I do agree that the son's name was probably rājyavarddhana, but in this sentence the term is in my opinion a common noun and is meant to be in compound: he was named after his qualities of being an increaser of the kingdom.

L8. Sircar's reading ttasyāpi is correct. There is something to the right of the head of the lower t, a stroke curving down as if it were tā. The ligature is definitely not sta, which would not be too surprising after kīrttiḥ. Compare ttasyaiṣa in line 10.

L8. pi ddha is unmetrical. Licence in svabhāva.

          <!--
L8. As Sircar observes, if dharmma-suta is understood as a comparison with Yudhiṣṭhira, then the stanza lacks a word meaning "son." (v9 also lacks such a noun; there, Sircar assumes that the subject of v11 was meant to apply there.)

L9. Sircar notes that the k part in śakra is malformed. śa and kra are very close together; k seems to lack a vertical stem between the arms and the subscript r, and the subscript r has a serif at the end. All characters are unambiguous, but the shape of kra is unusual.

L10. Iti is unmetrical. Sircar reads itī, assuming a metri causa lengthening, but the stone has iti. As Sircar comments, using e.g. kṣitīndraḥ in place of nr̥penduḥ would have served. Note also that the inscription usually has ri instead of r̥; once r̥ instead of ri (adr̥, l13), so probably they pronounced nr̥ as nri.

L10. Sircar emends sadarppa to sudarppa, translating "This is his [virtuous son] who humbled the great arrogance of the best of war-elephants; whose rutting elephants tore asunder by the strokes of their tusks the chests (of the war-elephants of the enemies); the temples (of the enemies' elephants) were split open for the exudation of ichor, (and) they, when struck by the fall of arrows (discharged by Yaśogupta and his men), became distressed (and) returned to the battle-arrays (of the enemies)." I find this amount of interpretive addition exorbitant and think that he captured the elephants of his enemies, simultaneously robbing them of their pride.

L10. rppa has the top of the principal p closed and the repha attached on the right, so it looks like rbpa. The intent was probably to draw a curved (mirrored L-shaped) repha on the left, though compare punya in l5 and sūnur in l6.
-->
          <!--
L10. Sircar emends to vakṣāḥ and assumes this is a plural form, using the stem *vakṣa, just like yaśa repeatedly in the inscription. He takes it to qualify the war elephants of the enemies, supplied by him. I prefer to understand it as a singular form qualifying Gauri, in which case the form vakṣaḥ is correct with the assumption that the stem is vakṣa. (I.e. I assume only a grammatical solecism, while Sircar assumes both a solecism and a scribal mistake.)

L11. Sircar reads vitatā°. The preceding tva is also faint, especially its v component; and the character SI reads as vi is unidentifiable. It definitely doesn't include an i mātrā. The only way I can interpret it is to assume that it is a very small sa (about half the height of the following ta, but comparable to the t component of the preceding tva), plus some damage, plus a dot below it that is also damage.
-->
          <!--
L11. Sircar emends °ārtthibhi to ārtthiṣu, noting that ārtthibhyo would be unmetrical.

L12. As Sircar notes, yasya sarassu is unmetrical in spite of all licences conceivable. I must add that the image itself is very poor. The reading, however, is clear.
-->
          <!--
L12. Sircar reads kamudo° an emends. ku is clear in the stone.
-->
          <!--
L12. Sircar emends niśāmya to niśamya. I believe both forms are correct but I may be wrong. Monier-Williams actually gives only niśāmya (and niśamayya).

L12. Sircar reads striyo with an unclear t, but there is definitely no t in the character.

          <!--
L12. Note the word aṁṅśrubhi, which on the one hand must involve a Prakritism (if that is what the nasalisation is; compare Hindi आंसू), and on the other hand another metri causa deviation from grammar.
-->
          <!--
L12. Note also (as Sircar does) that padma is normally neuter; S. would emend to padmaM.

          <!--
L12. The punctuation sign at the end of v10 is a double vertical, the first with a hook at the top left. This is the first such sign in this inscription. The preceding halanta N has a double line above it.

As Sircar notes, vapuṣaḥ must have been intended as a nominative singular, not a genitive; the stem is *vapuṣa just as in v11b.

L14. Note the use of a halanta consonant at the caesura. The use of dariśana, . . . = instead of darśana = . = is also interesting from a metrical point of view, but unfortunately it may be simply due to the incompetence of the composer. Likewise, ayaM with halanta character at caesura could be metrically interesting but we've had other halanta characters inside a pāda without a caesura above.

L14. Sircar reads pūnya and emends the ū as well as the n. I think this is more likely u, though the identification is problematic, see note on punya in l5.

          <!--
L14. As Sircar notes, the use of anusvāra in punyaṁ is probably metri causa: a vowel with anusvāra must have been implicitly heavy.

L15. For ṇyapyate, Sircar believes "An expression like khyāpyate is apparently intended". The reading is clear. I believe the intent was jñapyate.

L16. Sircar suggests emending sagamat to tv agamat. I believe sa was intended as a pronoun to serve as a subject for the sentence (and point back to prāsāda in the preceding verse); gamat must have been meant for an aorist. Another possibility is that Agamat had been intended and incorrectly engraved, in which case we have non-standard sandhi but no serious grammatical error.
