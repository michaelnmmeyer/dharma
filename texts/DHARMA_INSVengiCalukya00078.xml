                    <p>Halantas. Final T (e.g. l13, l18) is a regular ta with just a wiggly tail (upward and to the right) instead of a V-shaped headmark. Final N (e.g. l16, l43) is a much reduced and simplified na without a headmark, while in l46 it is an extremely simplified and reduced na with a wiggly tail. In l46, ka is erroneously inscribed instead of final K, and l47 has ta instead of final T.</p>
                    <p>Original punctuation marks are simple straight vertical, generally slightly shorter than a character body is tall; occasionally very short. The opening symbol consists of two concentric circles; the outer circle has four wavy appendages in the cardinal directions, and four dots spaced in the intercardinals.</p>
                    <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāras are placed at median height after the character to which they belong. They may be moved to the next line (l27) or across a binding hole (l37). Vowel markers are generally just small extensions, outward and down, on the left, right or both sides, of the V-shaped headmark, when such a headmark exists in a consonant. Dependent au, when distinguished from o, has a taller right hump (e.g. lines 25, 26, 32; see also o corrected to au in line 7). Subscript consonants are as a rule simplified, and are often ambiguous outside context, e.g. ṣṣa looks like ṣva. Repeatedly (lines 77, 78, 92, 96, 103), a combination of short <foreign>u</foreign> and <foreign>ā</foreign> (attached to the headmark, not to the end of the <foreign>u</foreign> marker) is used to represent long <foreign>ū</foreign>. (But compare the properly written <foreign>kūṁdavā</foreign> in line 61.) Since this double <foreign>uā</foreign> marker is not a plausible scribal mistake, it is probably a deliberately employed alternate notation; nonetheless, I mark it up as erroneous usage.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

        <note>According to Fleet's note, an originally inscribed <foreign>tā</foreign> has been corrected into <foreign>bhara</foreign> here.

        <note>Fleet offers no solution for this problematic locus. I emend tentatively, but I think the character Fleet read as <foreign>ra</foreign> can pass for a final <foreign>M</foreign>, providing an object to the verb <foreign>abhunak</foreign>. I assume that this sentence was meant to be in <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>; it certainly belongs semantically with the preceding half-stanza in that metre. The loose parallel <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00052.xml">Andhra Sahitya Parishad plates of Śaktivarman</ref>, in the <foreign>śārdūlavikrīḍita</foreign> metre, has <foreign>sannaddhaṁ yudhi yuddhamallam avaner nnirddhāṭya dhāṭyāharat</foreign>, so it is also possible that <foreign>dharaṇeḥ</foreign> or <foreign>dhāriṇeḥ</foreign> was meant here in parallel to <foreign>avaner</foreign>; but this seems less likely since we have no verb parallelling <foreign>aharat</foreign> here.</note>

        <note>I am quite certain that the first character of this sequence is <foreign>tsu</foreign>, not <foreign>su</foreign>. If so, then given the preceding scribal blunders (for which see the previous note), an omitted character is not unlikely, and the restoration <foreign>tat-suto</foreign> is very plausible. It is also possible that more than one character was omitted, and the composer's intent had been <foreign>atha tat-suto</foreign>, which would perhaps explain the <foreign>ra</foreign> at the end of the previous locus. Further on, I am also uncertain about <foreign>to</foreign>, but there seems to be a faint indication of <foreign>o</foreign> rather than <foreign>ā</foreign> in the BnF specimen of Elliot's rubbing.

        <note>According to Fleet, a word such as <foreign>vinā</foreign> is expected here.

It is also possible that a less ambiguous pre-drawn <foreign>dhu</foreign> has been mistakenly engraved as <foreign>n</foreign>. However, a superfluous <foreign>i</foreign> is definitely present and does not at all seem to have been deleted. Nonetheless, <foreign>dhu</foreign> may perhaps be a subsequent addition.

<p rend="stanza" n="8">King Amma’s brother by a different mother, known as Dānārṇava and versed in the sixty-four arts, ruled the earth for three years.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="9">Thereafter the earth, <supplied reason="subaudible">left</supplied> without a leader, seemed for twenty-seven years to be performing austerities to obtain a suitable husband.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="10">Then there was a king <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>rājan</foreign></supplied>, a <supplied reason="subaudible">veritable</supplied> Moon of the Cālukyas <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>cālukya-candra</foreign></supplied> <supplied reason="explanation">Śaktivarman</supplied>—born of Dānārṇava, endowed with the arts <seg rend="pun">possessing digits</seg>—who dispelled the suffering of the earth with his soft hands <seg rend="pun">with his pleasant rays</seg>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="11">“The worlds are upheld by Truth”—this dictum <supplied reason="subaudible">was proven</supplied> true because he, the King of Truth, the shelter of all the world <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>sarva-lokāśraya</foreign></supplied>, upheld the universe.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="12">Having destroyed his antagonists, he protected the circle of the earth fairly for twelve years, <supplied reason="subaudible">following</supplied> the just path <supplied reason="subaudible">along</supplied> with the kings of old.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="13">Then his younger brother named Vimalāditya took up sovereignty over the circle of the earth after he, the conqueror, conquered his enemies.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="14">Unable to bear the burning of his blazing valour, his enemies hurriedly fled willy-nilly in fear into the jungle and the ocean. Being scorched even there by him—the same <supplied reason="subaudible">though appearing</supplied> in the role of wildfire and the <supplied reason="explanation">submarine</supplied> Fire of Aurva—they <supplied reason="subaudible">finally</supplied> took shelter in the copious shade of the celestial tree of <supplied reason="subaudible">his</supplied> auspicious feet.</p>
<p n="55">On the other hand,</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="15">In the <supplied reason="explanation">Coḻa</supplied> lineage of the Sun <supplied reason="subaudible">was born one</supplied> comparable in puissance to <supplied reason="explanation">Indra</supplied> the Lord of the Gods, who shone in this world as His Majesty Rājarāja: a lord whose footstool was incarnadined by a veil of light from the gems atop the diadems of all rulers of men.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="16">From him was born King Rājendra Coḍa, a proud universal sovereign among kings who with his expansive reputation surmounted the glory of <supplied reason="subaudible">other</supplied> kings, and who infused the flood of the Immortal River <supplied reason="explanation">Ganges</supplied> with the rut fluid seeping from the cheeks of his elephants, terrifying in their rage.</p>

<p rend="stanza" n="18">That Vimalāditya, having accomplished his aims and being worthy of people’s praise, married his <supplied reason="explanation">Rājendra Coḻa’s</supplied> younger sister, the beautiful Great Queen Kūṁdavā, who was appropriate <supplied reason="explanation">for him</supplied>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="19">Thanks to the valour of his arms, he, the equal of the seven-horsed <supplied reason="explanation">sun</supplied>, protected the wide earth, girt by oceans, fairly for seven years.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="20">Now from that illustrious King Vimalāditya and from Queen Kuṁdavā, whose body was fashioned as if she were the Royal Fortune of the Coḍa kings, was born the crest jewel of the Cālukyas: His Majesty Rājarāja <supplied reason="explanation">I</supplied>, the king <supplied reason="subaudible">produced from</supplied> the majestic ocean that is the Dynasty of the Moon who seized the Royal Fortune of the Earth, whom <supplied reason="subaudible">only the most</supplied> resplendent warriors <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>rājanya</foreign></supplied> may approach.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="21">He was anointed to protect the earth when the Śaka years were positioned as the Vedas <supplied reason="explanation">4</supplied>, oceans <supplied reason="explanation">4</supplied> and treasures <supplied reason="explanation">9</supplied> <supplied reason="explanation">i.e. Śaka 944</supplied>, when the Sun was in Leo <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>siṁha</foreign></supplied>, in the Uttara-Bhadrikā <supplied reason="subaudible">lunar asterism</supplied> on the dark <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kr̥ṣṇa</foreign></supplied> <supplied reason="subaudible">fortnight’s</supplied> second day, on Thursday, under the excellent ascendant of Libra <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>vaṇij</foreign></supplied>.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="22">His head was bound by the great turban <supplied reason="explanation">of royalty</supplied>, raised by the populace in order to bear the burden of the earth for a long time.<note>I do not understand the implication of this stanza. Compare the slightly different version in stanza 17 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00079.xml">Kalidiṇḍi grant</ref>. Could the point of both (or at least of a hypothetical model from which both are distorted) be a comparison of the royal turban to the head padding worn by labourers who carry loads on their heads?</note></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="23">While he of extensive power, who has annihilated the host of enemies, protects the earth <seg cert="low">without partiality</seg>, his subjects—rid of droughts, bandits and disease—attain the group of three <supplied reason="explanation">aims</supplied> <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>trivarga</foreign></supplied> along with its fruits.</p>
<p rend="stanza" n="24">His <seg rend="pun">verdant</seg> youthful, <supplied reason="subaudible">but</supplied> by no means frail, reputation seems to spread the grandeur of a canopy of varied colours over the deities of the directions, being since birth <seg rend="pun">reddened by</seg> fond of countless virtues such as heroism, munificence and honour; being <seg rend="pun">exceedingly black</seg> greater than Kr̥ṣṇa through <supplied reason="subaudible">his</supplied> famous greatness; being <seg rend="pun">white</seg> bright as the moon; being <seg rend="pun">yellow</seg> imbibed happily by a host of good men through their ears resembling hands held to receive alms.<note>The central idea of this stanza is certainly that Rājarāja’s reputation is of many colours, which are expressed in bitextual understandings of words that the reader would first understand in a different sense. Since reputation <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>kīrti</foreign></supplied> is often compared to a creeper, I believe the simile also involves a plant. This is perhaps implied by the word <foreign>abhinavā</foreign> (youthful, verdant); also compare stanza 6 of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00039.xml">Māṁgallu grant of Dānārṇava</ref> for a similar idea. However, the vegetable connection may not have been present in the composer’s mind, and Rājarāja’s reputation may be pictured as an actual canopy or awning spread over all quarters of the horizon. This latter image is expressed in much simpler terms in line 9 of the <ref n="tfb-badamicalukya-epigraphy" target="CalE06-Chiplun-Pulakesin2.xml">Cipḷūṇ plates of Pulakeśin II</ref>.</note></p>
<p rend="stanza" n="25">The founders of his parents’ dynasties were verily the Sun and the Moon: the two Eyes of the World, the gods who dispel darkness with their scintillating brilliance.

Compare stanza 1. Alternatively, the text may need emendation (see the apparatus to line 79) to mean, “Infinitely far from the end, there was born the original cause…”</note> the cause of the birth of the light of the worlds and the substrate <supplied reason="explanation"><foreign>dhāman</foreign></supplied> of <supplied reason="subaudible">all</supplied> creatures.
