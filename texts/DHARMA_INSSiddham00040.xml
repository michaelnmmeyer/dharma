This inscription is digitally edited by Dániel Balogh from photographs of the original stone (taken at Gwalior Museum in January 2017). Alternative opinions are cited from Fleet in CII3 (F), Bühler_1890 (Bü), Bhandarkar in CII3rev (Bh) and Sircar in SI. Restorations, unless otherwise noted, were originally proposed by Fleet. Encoded for Siddham by Dániel Balogh. Version of January 2019. Comments below are offered "as is" and do not represent a thoroughly researched or considered opinion.

L1. For my restoration bhr̥tyartham, F and SI read vr̥tyartham, emending to vr̥ttyartham. Bh reads dhr̥tyartham. All of them show the first consonant as an unclear reading, not as a restoration. #Basham_1983 translates "that they may live", probably based on vr̥tty. In the rubbing and the stone, only the r̥ mātrā and a vertical stem are visible; I see no trace of a character body, but the bottom part of the body should be extant if it was v or dh. Hence my restoration bh, which I see as slightly more likely than the other alternatives.

L10. For vapuṣaḥ, Fleet reads vadhavaḥ. RG Bhandarkar proposed vapuṣaḥ or vibhavāḥ as an emendation. Durgaprasad actually read vapuṣaḥ. Bhandarkar says the text is certainly vadhuṣaḥ, and emends to vapuṣaḥ. Agrawal_1986:57 claims to have "verified the reading from the original stone" and says "The reading is certainly manojña-vapuṣaḥ". The characters are damaged, so anyone who calls a reading certain is subjective. The subscript u is practically clear so vibhavāḥ is out, and the top of the character is wide and seems to have two separate points, so dh is also probably out and p is as certain (in my own subjective opinion) as one can be.

L11. Fleet had read lokayātrāmaraiś, accepted by Bühler and SI. Durgaprasad corrected to loka-yātrā-paraiś; according to Bhandarkar, the impressions give the reading loka-yātr-āparaiś. Frankly, I don't see how this could look any different in the inscription from what Durgaprasad said; in any case, lokayātrā-para makes sense, while lokayātrā-apara does not, to me. At any rate, the problematic character is definitely p in the stone.

L12. Fleet reads priyam and emends agryāṁ to aśryāṁ. Correct reading first pointed out by Bühler_1890 (also, perhaps independently, by #Agrawal_1940:60). Basham translates "go to meet her lover" and says the verse is about an abhisārikā, so he was not aware of or rejected the correction. gryā is clear; śri is not quite clear but certain.

L12. Instead of sparśavatā, #Agrawal_1940:60 proposes to read sparśāj jāta, which seems unmetrical to me. He says Fleet's va is a conjunct, and the lower letter is probably j; of the rest he is not certain. Sircar agrees it is unmetrical but notes that sparśajāta would be OK. This, however, would go against Agrawal's claim that the third character is a ligature. In the rubbing, the third character does indeed seem to have a subscript component which may well be j. It could also be d or y or something else. The upper part of the character is indistinct due to damage. In my photos, the apparent subscript component also seems to be nothing more than shallow damage, so I retain sparśavatā. The word is attested in the MBh and Kumārasambhava as meaning "pleasant to the touch".

L13. Fleet: viśālāṁs teṣāṁ śubhā matir abhūd acalā tatas tu. Bühler: śubhe. Bhandarkar: viśālān teṣāṁ śubhe matir abhūd acalā tatas taiḥ. SI: viśālāṁ(ste)ṣāṁ śubhā (ma)ti(r abhūd a)calā tatas tu. Sircar connects the end of this stanza to kāritaṁ in v29, saying "The intervening verses are by way of a parenthesis." Bhandarkar's taiḥ still requires (even more strongly) that we continue the sentence in v29, but seems to be more likely on the basis of the stone. (His translation seems to imply he took taiḥ as the logical subject of pravicintya, but I don't think that is possible.)
--><!--
L13. In my opinion, viśālān teṣāṁ is very likely. The end of the stanza is unclear both in the rubbing and unfortunately also in my photographs. I am quite certain there is a halanta consonant at the end, not a visarga. My own reading is also awkward, since tasmin (meant to go with śubhe) doesn't really serve any function in the sentence, but less awkward than tatas tu or tatas taiḥ. Aside from acale ca, acalaiva or acaleva may also be possible, and so may tasmāt instead of tasmin. tasmāt may give a better sentence (having thought, they therefore...), but I think i is more likely than ā. Le seems to be formed in two different ways in the inscription. In l22, kāle has an e mātrā attached to the bottom left corner of the body. But more commonly, e.g. kāle in l18, it is basically a cross-stroke in the stem of l, probably intended so that the long curl of the stem is cut off by the cross stroke, and an e mātrā looking like the curl is attached to the top of that. In this particular locus, neither of these solutions is clearly visible, but either may be possible and both are in my opinion more likely than an ā. What looks like a downward slanting (thus not really a-like) stroke from the top right corner in the rubbing does not, in the photos, seem to be a carved line. In l11, lai seems to use neither of these strokes; instead, it seems to consist of a regular long-tailed l, with two little slanted mātrās on top of the curve.

L13. F reads samudrānta, Bü and SI follow. Bhandarkar avers that samudrāmbu is more likely. The problematic character doesn't look like a conjunct to me, but the top part may well be b (compare br̥hat a little later on), and there may well be an anusvāra before it, so I opt to read samudrāṁbu. This may have been what Bhandarkar intended, though he spells m, not anusvāra, both in his edition and in his footnote.

L17. For bhavane dara, Fleet's reading was (ra)cane dara, translated "which unites men with (their) lovely mistresses; which is agreeable with the warmth of the fire of the rays of the sun (shining) in the glens."  Sircar and Agrawala keep this reading. R. G. Bhandarkar suggested bhavane dara instead, translating "in which there are lovely women in the houses ... which is agreeable with the moderated heat of the fire of the rays of the Sun." Bühler adpots this (p24, Zur Zeit, wo die Häuser voll schöner Frauen sind, die angenehm ist ob der schwachen Sonnenstrahlen und der Wärme des Feuers, also noting that dara is synonymous with komala here). Kielhorn (1890:252) in turn suggested bhavanodara, saying that "heat of the fire of the Sun" would be redundant and dara would not be used by a poet to describe sunbeams. His conjecture is endorsed by Jagannath Agrawal and (D. R.) Bhandarkar, who also notes that gamanādara is also a possible reading (not that it makes much sense). On the basis of my photos of the stone, I deem racane impossible; bhavane and bhavano seem equally possible depending on whether the stroke to the right of the n is part of the vowel mark or a result of damage. Contra Kielhorn (ibid.) I believe that dara-bhāskarāṁśu would be semantically acceptable if interpreted to mean that the sun's rays are mild (ergo pleasant). Vahni-pratāpa in this reading would be attached to the preceding members of the compound as a dvandva, meaning not the fire of the sun's rays but that heat, when one needs it, comes from fires. However, the parallel r̥tusaṁhāra passage cited by Kielhorn (5.1-2) speaks of mandirodara and, separately, of bhānumato gabhastayaḥ. For this reason I am convinced that Kielhorn is right after all, and Vatsabhaṭṭi's verse had bhavanodara and bhāskarāṁśu.

Indeed, while ku is quite clear in the rubbing, the possible vowel mark is indistinct in my photos. The readings are both permitted by the evidence and both make sense in the context. I prefer to read kulā° on the one hand because joyous swarms of bees has been mentioned once before in the inscription (mada-pragalbhāli-kula, l6-7), and on the other hand because kala is primarily an adjective meaning "soft" applicable to sound (though it may also be a substantive meaning "soft sound").

L18. F reads nagaṇaika, translating "nagaṇā-bushes" and identifying this as Cardiospermum Halicacabum. SI keeps the reading nagaṇaika. Bühler (p24) translates "den Zweige der Lavalî und des Nagana" (n, not ṇ) but his edition (p95) has nagaṇa. Bhandarkar says the reading is clearly naganaika (analysed as nagan-aika). He translates "solitary branches of myriads of the lavalī creepers" and notes (330n2) that the interpretation "myriads" had been suggested by Shembavnekar in JIH, vol. X. p. 146 and Jagannath JIH, Vol. XVIII, pp. 118-119 (untraced, not in bibliography). From this it appears that he understands na-gaṇa as "myriad", interpreting ekaśākhe as "solitary branches." I don't quite see how this myriad thing works out (haven't checked Shembavanekar or Jagannath). Funny, am I the only one to understand naga+naika? Agrawal_1986a:77-78 has an entire (brief) article dedicated to explaining "nagaṇā" in this inscription. The paper is said to be reprinted from JIH 18 (is Agrawal the same as the above Jagannath?). He says it is indeed Cardiospermum halicacabum, as identified by Fleet; also known as heart pea and in Skt by various names including īngudī (sic). This is from the lexicon called ratnamālā, cited in HH Wilson's Skt dictionary.

Note also the use of the word vipula near that expected caesura - this may be an intentional wink. Sircar's problem may be what Bühler (1890:11) also points out, that there is a compound across the halfverse boundary. Also, there is no caesura before the 5th foot of the second half, though this foot comprises four light syllables, so a caesura may be required by convention before it.

L22. Bhandarkar again wants to correct to nagaṇ-aika, Agrawala likewise. Bhandarkar translates "solitary large branches of the Nagana," whatever that may be. I vote for naga as tree/plant, compare line 18.

L22. The punctuation dash at v42b is after, not between, the visarga dots. It's quite clear even though Bhandarkar does not print it at all.
