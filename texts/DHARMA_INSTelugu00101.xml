            <note>Prabhākaraśāstri notes that ⟨du⟩ could be read as well, and that the reading of ⟨ḍlu⟩ is uncertain and also could be ⟨jlu⟩ (notes nos. 3-4). The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> in question indeed looks like ⟨jlu⟩. As far as I can say from my bad scan the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> that was read as ⟨va⟩ by Prabhākara Śāstri could also be ⟨ma⟩. The following <foreign>akṣara</foreign> could be ⟨lla⟩ as spelled in the Zulakallu plates of Vijayāditya I (line 17) (<bibl>
                <ptr target="bib:Gai1965-1966_01"/>
              </bibl>), i. e. with the right upward line of the superscript ⟨l⟩ drawn downwards on the left side ending into subscript ⟨l⟩. The single ⟨la⟩ is written in its fuller form in line 4 of our Telugu inscription but also occurs in a slightly more advanced form in line 14.</note>

            <note>Prabhākaraśāstri says in note no. 5 that it could also be ⟨kku⟩ instead of ⟨ku⟩. <foreign>Jakkuṟē</foreign>- seems to me to be one word consisting of two elements in which the <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> would be superfluous (see commentary). However, a dot can be seen on top of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ga⟩ that may be a damage on the stone though.</note>

            <note>According to Prabhākaraśāstri the spelling should be ⟨pa⟩ (note no. 6); the respective verb would be <foreign>paḍayu</foreign>. The line that Prabhākaraśāstri read as the vowel sign ⟨°e⟩ starts on the left side from the middle of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨pa⟩. That would be very unusual because this vowel is normally written on the upper left line of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign>. The alleged vowel sign may therefore be simply a damage on the stone.</note>

            <note>In Prabhākaraśāstri's edition <foreign>renṭuṭḍiyu</foreign> is printed but that seems to be a mere misprint. The vowel sign is written to the left side and has a hook on top drooping towards the left. Therefore, the vowel seems to be long /uː/ seems to be written. The form appears to be a contraction of /uva/ to /uː/ of the already mentioned <foreign>reṇḍuvaṭṭi</foreign> (i. e. reṇḍuvaṭṭi > reṇḍūṭṭi)</note>

            <note>The akṣara ⟨I⟩ looks like ⟨I⟩ in line 4. The intended meaning, however, must be "this" (<foreign>ī</foreign>). Prabhākaraśāstri had a the original and the original estampage at his disposal wherefore his reading may be correct. However, I cannot see any vowel sign on ⟨ṇḍ⟩ and it seems that the vowel simply was forgotten. On the other hand, the lower part of ⟨ṭi⟩ seems to be damaged on the scan available to me so that it is also possible that the vowel sign of ⟨ṇḍ⟩ may have been lost due to damage. I supplied a long ⟨°ū⟩ due to the reading <foreign>reṇḍūṭṭi</foreign>- in line 11.</note>

            <note>According to Prabhākaraśāstri (note no. 11) the reading is unclear and also <foreign>canvaṁ</foreign> and <foreign>candhaṁ</foreign> are possible according to him (his alternative readings are very blurred in the bad scan at my disposal).The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨va⟩ is written in a little bit more elongated form than in e. g. line 14. The scribe forgot to write the horizontal line inside the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ṟa⟩ so that it is an empty oval and thus resembles a ⟨dha⟩ or ⟨va⟩. The reading <foreign>vanṟ agu</foreign> is what to be expected as can be seen from other inscriptions.</note>

            <note>According to Prabhākaraśāstri (note no. 12) this line is effaced. However, it seems to me that this line was intentionally left blank since the Telugu imprecation is now followed by a Sanskrit imprecation. The Telugu imprecation ends in its typical way so that no information is lacking that could have been given in line 18.</note>

            <note>The scan of Prabhākaraśāstri's article at my disposal is of a bad quality. On the picture I can see a shade of what could be interpreted as a ⟨śa⟩ but I can not see traces of subscript ⟨°ya⟩ in line 20. However, Prabhākaraśāstri may be right that the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨śa⟩ or ⟨śya⟩ was written twice by mistake. These two <foreign>pādas</foreign> normally are <foreign>pāda</foreign> 3 and 4 of a standard imprecation <foreign>śloka</foreign>. See commentary.</note>

            <note>Prabhākaraśāstri read the first <foreign>akṣara</foreign> of line 24 as ⟨pa⟩ but in my opinion it more resembles ⟨ṣa⟩. I think that this ⟨ṣa⟩ is the first <foreign>akṣara</foreign> of the third <foreign>pāda</foreign> of the respective <foreign>śloka</foreign> the first two <foreign>pādas</foreign> of which have been encarved on the stone. The last <foreign>akṣara</foreign> of line 24 normally is the second <foreign>akṣara</foreign> of the third pāda 3 (together <foreign>ṣaṣṭhi</foreign>). See commentary.</note>

               I have to stress that my own reading is based on the picture in Prabhākaraśāstri's edition. I only had access to a bad scan. That is why my reading might be faulty in one or the other place and I apologize if I mistakingly "corrected" Prabhākaraśāstri's edition for the bad.</p>
        <p>Prabhākaraśāstri interprets <foreign>kaḍuvaṁ<unclear>ḍlu</unclear>la</foreign>, as he reads it, in lines 3-4 as the name of a village in the locative (<cit>
            <quote>కడువండ్లులగ్రామమున [kaḍuvaṁḍlulagrāmamuna]</quote>
            <bibl rend="omitname">

              <citedRange unit="page">937</citedRange>
            </bibl>
          </cit>). He regards <foreign>miriyampu bōḷaja</foreign> (with the dative suffix -<foreign>ku</foreign>) as the donée and <foreign>ṟeṁgari</foreign> as the donor (<bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/>
            <citedRange unit="page">937-937</citedRange>
          </bibl>). The semantics of <foreign>paḍayu</foreign> ("to obtain, possess"), however, are problematic in my opinion. According to my reading <foreign>kaḍumallu</foreign> is a person's name which means something like "strong wrestler" (<foreign>kaḍu</foreign> + <foreign>mallu</foreign>). Prabhākaraśāstri interprets <foreign>bōḷaja </foreign> as consisting of <foreign>bōḷa</foreign> and an abbreviated Prakrit form of <foreign>ajja</foreign> (from <foreign>ārya</foreign>) (<bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/>
            <citedRange unit="page">942</citedRange>
          </bibl>). However, since double ⟨kku⟩ is written in line 6, which therefore can not be the dative suffix being written with a single ⟨k⟩, I would rather separate the usual designation <foreign>bōḷa</foreign> from the actual name that follows. The suffix -<foreign>gari</foreign> (i. e. -<foreign>gāri</foreign>) is the genitive of the honorific suffix -<foreign>g/vāru</foreign>. What remains is <foreign>jakkuṟē</foreign>- which consists of <foreign>ṟē</foreign>- "ruler" and <foreign>jakku</foreign> "yakṣa". Hence, <foreign>jakkuṟē</foreign>- means "ruler of the yakṣas" = Kubera.</p>
        <p>The two words <foreign>reṇḍuvaṭi</foreign> and <foreign>reṇḍuvaṭṭi</foreign> seem to refer to the same thing. The spelling <foreign>vaṭi</foreign> seems to be a haplography of the fuller <foreign>vaṭṭi</foreign> which, in my opinion, corresponds to Sanskrit <foreign>paṭṭī</foreign> "a plot of land" (p > v / V(#)_ is a normal sandhi). The contracted form <foreign>reṇḍūṭṭi</foreign> is unusual. However, similar contractions sometimes occur, e. g. <foreign>pandumbu</foreign> from <foreign>paḍudumbu</foreign>.</p>
        <p>The spelling <foreign>druggādēvi</foreign> seems to be a (spontaneous) metathesis of <foreign>Durgādēvi</foreign> "the goddess Durgā". The retainment of double ⟨gg⟩ rather serves to preserve the phonotactic structure of the word than simply being a remainder of the usual doubling of a consonant after <foreign>repha</foreign> because the preservation of the original phonotactic structure also seems to be the goal of vowel lengthening and consonant doubling after the usual metathesis in Telugu. Another example involving a loan word is uramu ~ rommu "chest, breast" (three morae each). Prabhākaraśāstri gives some more examples (<bibl rend="omitname">

        <p>
                      The place name <foreign>Uṟuvuṭuri</foreign> (obl.) is identified by Prabhākaraśāstri with the modern village Uruṭūru, near Guḍivāḍa to the north of the Kṛṣṇā river (<bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/>

        <p n="19-21">Ad lines 19-21: The <foreign>śloka</foreign> is not complete. The two <foreign>pādas</foreign> mentioned here normally form <foreign>pādas</foreign> c and d of a typical Sanskrit imprecation <foreign>śloka</foreign> one of several variants of which is:

                 </p>
        <p n="22-24">The next <foreign>śloka</foreign> is incomplete as well. This time because the last two <foreign>pādas</foreign> are missing. From the picture as published in the edition it is not possible to say whether there was more room on top of the stone for the effaced rest of the second <foreign>śloka</foreign> (because the inscription is written from the bottom to the top), or whether the stone is broken on top. Regarding the overall bad writing of the Sanskrit lines it is also possible that the scribe wanted to write only one single <foreign>śloka</foreign> but mixed up two <foreign>pādas</foreign> of different <foreign>ślokas</foreign> each. The misspelling in line 24 may corroborate this idea since the superfluous first and last <foreign>akṣaras</foreign> of the line together seem to form the first word of what should be the third <foreign>pāda</foreign> of this <foreign>śloka</foreign>: <foreign>ṣaṣṭhi</foreign> (this spelling, albeit wrong, occurs sometimes in other inscriptions, conf. INSTelugu00018, INSTelugu00027). The standard śloka would be:
                     <lb n="a"/>svadattāṁ paradattāṁ vā
                     <lb n="b"/>yo hareta vasundharāṁ
                     <lb n="c"/>ṣaṣṭirvvarṣa-sahasrāṇi
                     <lb n="d"/>viṣṭhāyāṁ jāyate kṛmiḥ</p>
        <p>I have edited these two <foreign>śloka</foreign>-parts as two different defective verses although they metrically form a single <foreign>śloka</foreign> because they do not form a coherent thought. The superfluous spellings of ⟨ṣa⟩ and ⟨ṣṭhi⟩ indicate that the scribe had the next lines of the second <foreign>śloka</foreign> at his disposal and seems to have intended to at least fill the line. That is why I think that the Sanskrit imprecation was mistakingly written as it is.
