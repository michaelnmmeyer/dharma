                            <p>The inscription is written from the bottom to the top. The <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> is placed on top of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> that it is pronounced before, e. g. lines 3 and 8 ⟨ṁbu⟩ (written as if denoting ⟨buṁ⟩). This is a feature that can be observed in several early Telugu inscriptions. The head of the <foreign>akṣaras</foreign> is often, but not always, written in an ornate manner in form of a little circle. There <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be one <foreign>halanta</foreign> in line 11 (⟨N⟩), written very small and without a "head".<!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet.

The <foreign>akṣara</foreign> in question indeed looks like ⟨jlu⟩. As far as I can say from my bad scan the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> that was read as ⟨va⟩ by Prabhākara Śāstri could also be ⟨ma⟩. The following <foreign>akṣara</foreign> could be ⟨lla⟩ as spelled in the Zulakallu plates of Vijayāditya I (line 17) (<bibl><ptr target="bib:Gai1965-1966_01"/></bibl>), i. e. with the right upward line of the superscript ⟨l⟩ drawn downwards on the left side ending into subscript ⟨l⟩. The single ⟨la⟩ is written in its fuller form in line 4 of our Telugu inscription but also occurs in a slightly more advanced form in line 14.</note>

                       <note>According to Prabhākaraśāstri the spelling should be ⟨pa⟩ (note no. 6); the respective verb would be <foreign>paḍayu</foreign>. The line that Prabhākaraśāstri read as the vowel sign ⟨°e⟩ starts on the left side from the middle of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨pa⟩. That would be very unusual because this vowel is normally written on the upper left line of the <foreign>akṣara</foreign>. The alleged vowel sign may therefore be simply a damage on the stone.</note>

The vowel sign is written to the left side and has a hook on top drooping towards the left. Therefore, the vowel seems to be long /uː/ seems to be written. The form appears to be a contraction of /uva/ to /uː/ of the already mentioned <foreign>reṇḍuvaṭṭi</foreign> (i. e. reṇḍuvaṭṭi > reṇḍūṭṭi)</note>

Prabhākaraśāstri had a the original and the original estampage at his disposal wherefore his reading may be correct. However, I cannot see any vowel sign on ⟨ṇḍ⟩ and it seems that the vowel simply was forgotten. On the other hand, the lower part of ⟨ṭi⟩ seems to be damaged on the scan available to me so that it is also possible that the vowel sign of ⟨ṇḍ⟩ may have been lost due to damage. I supplied a long ⟨°ū⟩ due to the reading <foreign>reṇḍūṭṭi</foreign>- in line 11.</note>

The scribe forgot to write the horizontal line inside the <foreign>akṣara</foreign> ⟨ṟa⟩ so that it is an empty oval and thus resembles a ⟨dha⟩ or ⟨va⟩. The reading <foreign>vanṟ agu</foreign> is what to be expected as can be seen from other inscriptions.</note>

               I have to stress that my own reading is based on the picture in Prabhākaraśāstri's edition. I only had access to a bad scan. That is why my reading might be faulty in one or the other place and I apologize if I mistakingly "corrected" Prabhākaraśāstri's edition for the bad.</p>
               <p>Prabhākaraśāstri interprets <foreign>kaḍuvaṁ<unclear>ḍlu</unclear>la</foreign>, as he reads it, in lines 3-4 as the name of a village in the locative (<cit><quote>కడువండ్లులగ్రామమున [kaḍuvaṁḍlulagrāmamuna]</quote><bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/><citedRange unit="page">937</citedRange></bibl></cit>). He regards <foreign>miriyampu bōḷaja</foreign> (with the dative suffix -<foreign>ku</foreign>) as the donée and <foreign>ṟeṁgari</foreign> as the donor (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/><citedRange unit="page">937-937</citedRange></bibl>). The semantics of <foreign>paḍayu</foreign> ("to obtain, possess"), however, are problematic in my opinion. According to my reading <foreign>kaḍumallu</foreign> is a person's name which means something like "strong wrestler" (<foreign>kaḍu</foreign> + <foreign>mallu</foreign>). Prabhākaraśāstri interprets <foreign>bōḷaja </foreign> as consisting of <foreign>bōḷa</foreign> and an abbreviated Prakrit form of <foreign>ajja</foreign> (from <foreign>ārya</foreign>) (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/><citedRange unit="page">942</citedRange></bibl>). However, since double ⟨kku⟩ is written in line 6, which therefore can not be the dative suffix being written with a single ⟨k⟩, I would rather separate the usual designation <foreign>bōḷa</foreign> from the actual name that follows. The suffix -<foreign>gari</foreign> (i. e. -<foreign>gāri</foreign>) is the genitive of the honorific suffix -<foreign>g/vāru</foreign>. What remains is <foreign>jakkuṟē</foreign>- which consists of <foreign>ṟē</foreign>- "ruler" and <foreign>jakku</foreign> "yakṣa". Hence, <foreign>jakkuṟē</foreign>- means "ruler of the yakṣas" = Kubera.</p>
                 <p>The two words <foreign>reṇḍuvaṭi</foreign> and <foreign>reṇḍuvaṭṭi</foreign> seem to refer to the same thing. The spelling <foreign>vaṭi</foreign> seems to be a haplography of the fuller <foreign>vaṭṭi</foreign> which, in my opinion, corresponds to Sanskrit <foreign>paṭṭī</foreign> "a plot of land" (p > v / V(#)_ is a normal sandhi). The contracted form <foreign>reṇḍūṭṭi</foreign> is unusual. However, similar contractions sometimes occur, e. g. <foreign>pandumbu</foreign> from <foreign>paḍudumbu</foreign>.</p>
                 <p>The spelling <foreign>druggādēvi</foreign> seems to be a (spontaneous) metathesis of <foreign>Durgādēvi</foreign> "the goddess Durgā". The retainment of double ⟨gg⟩ rather serves to preserve the phonotactic structure of the word than simply being a remainder of the usual doubling of a consonant after <foreign>repha</foreign> because the preservation of the original phonotactic structure also seems to be the goal of vowel lengthening and consonant doubling after the usual metathesis in Telugu. Another example involving a loan word is uramu ~ rommu "chest, breast" (three morae each). Prabhākaraśāstri gives some more examples (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/><citedRange unit="page">943-944</citedRange></bibl>).</p>
                  <p>
                      The place name <foreign>Uṟuvuṭuri</foreign> (obl.) is identified by Prabhākaraśāstri with the modern village Uruṭūru, near Guḍivāḍa to the north of the Kṛṣṇā river (<bibl rend="omitname"><ptr target="bib:Prabhākaraśāstri1928_01"/><citedRange unit="page">945</citedRange></bibl>).

                 <p n="19-21">Ad lines 19-21: The <foreign>śloka</foreign> is not complete. The two <foreign>pādas</foreign> mentioned here normally form <foreign>pādas</foreign> c and d of a typical Sanskrit imprecation <foreign>śloka</foreign> one of several variants of which is:

                               <lb n="a"/>bahubhir vvasudhā dattā
                               <lb n="b"/>bahubhiś cānupālitā

                 </p>
                 <p n="22-24">The next <foreign>śloka</foreign> is incomplete as well. This time because the last two <foreign>pādas</foreign> are missing. From the picture as published in the edition it is not possible to say whether there was more room on top of the stone for the effaced rest of the second <foreign>śloka</foreign> (because the inscription is written from the bottom to the top), or whether the stone is broken on top. Regarding the overall bad writing of the Sanskrit lines it is also possible that the scribe wanted to write only one single <foreign>śloka</foreign> but mixed up two <foreign>pādas</foreign> of different <foreign>ślokas</foreign> each. The misspelling in line 24 may corroborate this idea since the superfluous first and last <foreign>akṣaras</foreign> of the line together seem to form the first word of what should be the third <foreign>pāda</foreign> of this <foreign>śloka</foreign>: <foreign>ṣaṣṭhi</foreign> (this spelling, albeit wrong, occurs sometimes in other inscriptions, conf. INSTelugu00018, INSTelugu00027). The standard śloka would be:
                     <lb n="a"/>svadattāṁ paradattāṁ vā
                     <lb n="b"/>yo hareta vasundharāṁ
                     <lb n="c"/>ṣaṣṭirvvarṣa-sahasrāṇi
                     <lb n="d"/>viṣṭhāyāṁ jāyate kṛmiḥ</p>

                 <p>I have edited these two <foreign>śloka</foreign>-parts as two different defective verses although they metrically form a single <foreign>śloka</foreign> because they do not form a coherent thought. The superfluous spellings of ⟨ṣa⟩ and ⟨ṣṭhi⟩ indicate that the scribe had the next lines of the second <foreign>śloka</foreign> at his disposal and seems to have intended to at least fill the line. That is why I think that the Sanskrit imprecation was mistakingly written as it is.
