The editions of Sircar_1943a, Sanyal and Agrawala (who may be copying Sircar SI) differ in many small details, e.g. over what they show as clear and unclear. I'm keeping track only of major editorial differences, and mark the text up according to my reading of the facsimile.

As Sanyal's editor notes, the first character of l5 actually looks like do, not dā.
--><!--
The segmentation of the names may be different in places; editors seem to agree on most. I'd expect a guy called kumārayaśas after all the kumāra-somethings.
--><!--
At the end, Sircar reads ya(?śa)#1#stavai(?khi)lina(?ka); Sanyal sees ya(śogu)pta-vailinandi while Agrawala has ya(śogu)pta-vailinaka. Sanyal's editor also remarks that the last character does not look like ndi.

For prabhamitra, Sanyal and Agrawala read prabhumitra. I agree with Sanyal's editor: the character is definitely bha; compare prabhu in l3 and bhava in l8.
--><!--
At the end I follow the reading suggested by Sanyal's editor and adopted by Agrawala. Sanyal himself read bhavanā(tha)#1#, while Sircar read nothing after bhava. Segmentation is arbitrary.
--><!--
I think an initial ī is rare enough to deserve comment. Initial i in this inscription looks like :| while this ī character is :|° (single dot, not circle, to the right of the bar).

Editors readings for the end of the line - Sircar_1943a: svā(?mya) #3# (?rū)paśa - Sanyal: ṣaṣṭhirā(ma)-gu . . . . (śa) - Agrawala: ṣaṣṭhi(rāta) ga #3# śa (proposing to restore Gaṇapati or Guhapati). I can imagine a number of other possibilities, e.g. svāmi for ṣaṣṭhi; datta and śarmma for the next two characters; and bra[#hm]aśa for the last 3.

For uṇṭaśarmma, Sircar reads ruṣṭaśarmma. Both seem equally possible and this is at least meaningful.

All editors emend siṅhatta to siṅhadatta.
--><!--
Sanyal's editor says it's ṭakka, not taṅka. Sircar reads śarvvaviṣṇuvi #3# kuladāsa #2#. The character after vi is indiscernible, but certainly a ligature. The one after that (ta/ṭa) is just a trace, could be ṭa, not ta, perhaps dha or ba.The next one is imo definitely not ṅka; could be ssa or kṣa. Then kuladāma seems plausible, though it looks more like dī and sa is possible instead of ma. Sanyal also reads a va at the very end of the line, which I cannot see.

For the name I tentatively read as kobhaka, Sircar (uncertainly) and Agrawala (certainly) have kālaka, Sanyal just has kā..., and his editor suggests kāluka. Perhaps combine to koluka? lu is more plausible than la.

The restoration of the illegibly corroded end of the line is shared by all editors (though Sanyal spells "dāmnośca a", presumably to account for the space of 4-5 characters). I could also imagine dāmnor a; the ca seems superfluous to me.
--><lb break="no" n="18"/>vadhāraṇayāvadhr̥to sty ayam iha vīthyām apratikara-khila-kṣettrasya śaśvat-kālopabhogāyākṣayanīvyā dvi-dī<unclear>nā</unclear><!--
The character ttra is quite unclear but it does seem to be ttra, whereas above kṣetra was repeatedly spelt with a single t.
--><!--
The gā in bhogāya is funny. The character was obviously intended as gā, so I'm transcribing it as such, but it looks (almost but not quite) like gra. The intent is probably an ā mātrā attached to the lower right.
--><lb break="no" n="19"/>rikya-kulya-bāpa-vikkrayo nuvr̥ttas tad dīyatāṁ nāsti virodhaḥ kaścid<supplied reason="subaudible">.</supplied> ity avasthāpya kulika-bhīmādibhyo Aṣṭādaśa

Agrawala attempts to reconstruct the end as viṣikhā-nadyāṁ (dyāṁ in the next line, that is). Earlier editors just transcribe a lacuna after grāmeṣu. I think the second vowel mātrā is ī, not i. The last character is absolutely illegible. I might hazard vibhītakyādyāṁ, but this doesn't really make sense.
--><lb break="no" n="21"/>dyāṁ dakṣiṇoddeśeṣu Aṣṭau kulya-bāpāḥ dhānyapāṭalikā-grāmasya paścimottaroddeśe <gap quantity="1" reason="illegible" unit="character"/> dy<unclear>o</unclear> <gap quantity="1" reason="illegible" unit="character"/> <unclear>ta-pa</unclear>rikhā-veṣṭi<unclear>ta</unclear><!--
The "mo" of paścimottara looks rather like ṇa. Compare l11 of IN00026 (Damodarpur plate 1) where the reading is paścinattar° emended to paścimottar° - that could be the same case. In l7 of the present inscription, mo looks the same, so this is not a "typo" here.
--><!--
For the damaged bit near the end of l21, Sircar reads (?sadyaḥkhāta); Sanyal: (ā)dyakhāta; Agrawala: (ṣvā)dyakhāta. The first unclear character is imo completely unrecognisable; dy may or may not have a vowel mātrā above it; the next unclear character looks to me quite different from khā just a few characters onward in this line; after that, ta seems to have something below it (tsa? tma?) and the subscript thing also seems to be connected to pa, unless it's ma or something else (though parikhā makes good sense). I could also imagine ādyapathaḥ (or [°ddeśe]ṇādyapathaḥ, as in l23 below. In this case the visarga seems to be a later insertion, wedged below (tha) and the following pa and slightly below the regular placement.

Sanyal's editor notes that yāva appears to be written on an erasure and is doubtful. There may indeed be correction here, perhaps "yāvat" corrected to "eva ku"; I could also imagine a scenario where the text first inscribed was kulyabā, corrected to yāva ku.
--><lb break="no" n="25"/>deśeṣv eṣāṁ kulika-bhīma-kāyastha-prabhucandra-rudradāsādīnāṁ mātā-pitroḥ puṇyābhivr̥ddhaye brā<unclear>hmaṇa</unclear>

At the end, Agrawala prints nivedya as clear and emends ti at the beginning of the next line to te. (This is also the reading/emendation suggested by Sanyal's editor.) Previous editors read nothing after yuṣmākaṁ. The suggestion is plausible. I could also imagine reading bhi instead of ti at the beginning of the next line, to give us abhilikhyate - but then we need a different reading for this line end here.

Sanyal reads the end as pālanam Iti, supplying daṇḍas in between. His editor notes that it seems to be pālanam=iti. I can make out na, and there is something that looks like an i mātrā after it, which probably belongs to mi.

I'm pretty sure there are 3 or 4 further characters after the end of the verse. None of the previous editors transcribe or mention it. It looks like #isatina, but I'm transcribing it as a very tentative likhitaṁ.

Line 34 is squeezed into very little vertical space and contains characters only in two places, near the centre of the line and near the end. The word sa(ṁ)vvat begins below ma of mahīm; vaiśākha begins below the yo of chreyo.
--><!--
Between sa(ṁ) and vvat there is another character that Sircar_1943a:24n44 takes to be a deleted character, perhaps mba. Other editors do not mention it.

The halanta T of saṁvvat is again linked at the top to the previous character.

Sircar and Agrawala read the date as 120. But N. B. Sanyal in Sen_1942:xii.n says it is 121, and Sanyal_1955-56 reiterates 121. Sircar_1943a:26n says he is aware of the faint scratches Sanyal sees as "1" but these are much further away from 20 than 20 is from 100 and thus they cannot be a third numeral. Sanyal_1955-56:66n3 insists that "The sign is distinct in the original" (to which he had access, while Sircar worked from inked impressions alone), while Sanyal's editor (ibid.) says "The reading 20 1 seems be [sic] supported neither by the original nor by the impressions" But this needs checking in hardcopy; my digital versions are badly scanned at the critical point and the note may not in fact say "20 1" but something else, and may have the missing "to" after seems. In my opinion the sign does look quite distinct, but I agree completely with Sircar that if it were a 1 rather than an accidental scratch, it would be much closer to the 20. The character above the place where the 1 should be (tāṁ of mahimatāṁ) does extend down to this line, but there would have been plenty of space below it to fit in a horizontal dash. I should also add that this line is much longer than the 1 after vaiśākha at the end of this line and the 2-s above in this plate, which again implies that it's an accidental scratch.
