This edition is based on Sircar_1963b (S); Thaplyal seems to reprint Sircar's text exactly.

L1. #Sircar_1963b:125 observes that "In the left-hand side of the upper margin on the obverse of the plate, the akshara ra is found between two symbols. This letter seems to have been meant for insertion in a line from which it was omitted through oversight. But the omission cannot be satisfactorily located in the extant part of the epigraph." The "ra" is above the ta of vāsita in l1. The symbol after it looks like the glyph for ñca. Of the symbol preceding it, there is no trace in the rubbing. If this is an insertion, it may have been meant to go at the end of l1 (see note on the unclear rā). But the inscription has several insertions, all of which are written below the line - so why would an insertion float at the top? Instead, these may be numbers (though I have no idea of their function): the "ra" could perhaps be 1000, and the "ñca" may be 50 or 200. 
--><!-- 
L1. The mangala symbol resembles a figure 9. 
--><!-- 
L1. The last unclear rā, if it is there at all, may well be a subsequent addition. Its descender is practically at the edge of the plate so there is certainly no room for it to have had an ā mātrā. Could the "ra" in the top margin be meant to come here? Probably not, in my opinion.

          <!-- 
L5-6. The ra at the end of the line, like in l1, is at the very edge. Ya is inserted below pu. The first character of śaśī has a mark above it, looking like a repha or a repha plus an e mātrā. (Sircar: "an unnecessary mark above śa".) Is it possible vapur śaśī was first inscribed, then corrected to vapur aya[+ṁ] śaśī? The rś sandhi would be peculiar, but this would explain the strange things going on here.

          <!-- 
L6. S prints pūrṇa, but the plate clearly has pūrṇṇa. 
-->
          <!-- 
L6. S reads lajya. The bottom part definitely doesn't look like a proper subscript y. I think it is a slightly funny subscript j, with the middle prong invisible, and the rest drawn more cursively than a regular ja. 
-->
          <!-- 
L6. S reads °ārjuna vīv(u), emending to °ārjuno vidhuḥ. I think we can accept the last character as a passable dhu; it is certainly different from the preceding v, though quite similar to the v of lajjayeva, and admittedly not quite the same as the dh of °dhikārika in l8. I find the verse, with this emendation, singularly awkward; if it has any decent sense, I don't see it and Sircar gives no clue. I wonder if the intent was °ārjunaṁ vidhuḥ, which requires less emendation and may be wordplay based on vidhu as Moon and Kr̥ṣṇa (with arjuna as a proper name too). I don't know when and how Kr̥ṣṇa would "take on his complete form [only] slowly out of shyness" when he sees Arjuna (perhaps he doesn't want to shock his friend with a viśvarūpa-darśana?), but this way at least we'd have some reason for the presence of the iva. It is also possible that the ī mātrā is actually i attached to the (dh), but this doesn't seem to make sense.

L7. For my surabhakṣe, S reads surabhākre. I think kr is impossible; compare kṣa in l8. I retain Sircar's and yāmyāyāṁ since I have nothing better to offer. Both readings are doubtful and may involve correction. Sircar, plausibly, thinks these are simply three villages, surabhākra, yāmyā and harigrāmaka. He restores ca at the end of the line, but there is no way another character could have fit there, so this is an editorial addition, not a true restoration. Since we do not have ca, perhaps yāmyā (or whatever the correct reading is) is actually another level of territorial division. All the more so, actually, as all adjectives and the predicate below are in the singular (though without a proper case ending).

L10. S reads grām(ā) and adds a visarga. I think a singular was more probably intended, see my note to l7 above, and the forms in the subsequent lines.

L11. S reads sagarttvaṣara, emending to sagarttoṣara. I think o is actually there in the original, and we only have an unnecessary v. 
--><!-- 
L11. S reads sva-sīmā. I see no trace of v, so I prefer to read sva. Nonetheless it may be necessary to emend to sva; Sircar's Epigraphical Glossary (p407) has several parallels. The ī of sī is actually probably ā, but I accept it as a malformed ī. 
--><!-- 
L11-12. Sircar emends to °sthalāḥ, °madhūkāḥ, °oṣarāḥ, °paryantāḥ, °pallikāḥ, °ākarāḥ, soddraṅgāḥ, soddeśāḥ. (See also note to l10 and l17.)

L12. S reads sassu, emending to sarvva. I'm not sure there was correction here, but there may well have been. I do not see a recognisable ssu, but think an original stha, sta or sva may have been corrected (rather poorly) to rvva. 
--><!-- 
L12. S reads soddraṅga (emending to soddraṅgāḥ). The reading seems to be sau, or may be a correction from sai to so. S also reads soddeśa (emending to °āḥ), but though the intent was clearly dd, the character is ṭṭ.

L13. I retain Sircar's reading of pratyādāya-sametād, but pra looks like tra, sa is unclear, and m is pratcically gone. S emends to pratyādāyā yāvad, which does result in pretty intelligible text, but seems a bit arbitrary. It fits nicely with S's emendation of all preceding nouns (and the participle in l17) to plurals, but works only in tandem with that long string of emendations, and the omission of "yāva" doesn't seem a very likely scribal mistake.
