Editions referred to below are Shastri's (S) and Shrimali's (Shri). The former is in EI41 for 1975-76, but only published in 1989. The latter was published in 1987. Shrimali says the inscription was published by Shastri in "Mandhal Utkhanana" in VSMA 1977, which I have not seen. Presumably Shri is a verbatim reproduction of this earlier edition by Shastri, and Shastri's EI edition is a different version that may be either later or earlier.

Line i. . Shri reads vākāṭhaka-lamamesya. I think the right-hand side of his ṭha is a scratch. I'm also quite certain that the apparent e mātrā in his lamamesya is actually the right limb of the preceding ma. The second ma is a bit scratchy, but doesn't seem to have been corrected to lā.

            <!--
Line iv. Shri reads ripuśāsina. I think the apparent i mātrā (not read by S) is probably a random scratch. However, Shastri also says (in a note to his text, #Shastri_1975-76a:71n2) that the last word "is intended to be ripu-śāsinaḥ", so he did read i at one stage at least. (And that was the stage when Shrimali printed his version, if that too is by Shastri in fact.) And actually I find this suggestion very intriguing. Could this be the original form of the vākāṭaka seal legend, and all other known specimens corruptions? Saying that Pravarasena's (or whoever's) command is a command (even) to his enemies is grand, but sort of out of context on a CP. But saying that "(this is) the command of Pravarasena (or whoever), who commands (even) his enemies" is a nice turn of phrase and obviously relevant to a CP.

L4. S and Shri read atyatna and that is what the ligature resembles; however, the same ligature is used at the end of the line (where S reads it as nn) and I think we should assume that nn is what it was meant to be even though the upper part looks like t.
--><!--
L4. S's edition has "Mahābhairava-bhe(bhai)rava." The dittography is definitely a typo in the edition; the reading bhe is possible (Shri also reads bherava), but I think bhai is also possible.
--><!--
L4. At the end of the line, Shri reads sarivave, while S reads sannivi. In S's rubbing the first n of the ligature is clear (though it looks like t, see second earlier note) and there are traces of the second n; Shri probably only saw the vertical, but I don't know where he got his vave. The v at the end almost certainly has an i mātrā, though it is smudged - perhaps the engraver wanted to correct it to ve, botched it and decided to re-engrave it at the beginning of the next line, where for some reason it again ended up as vi.

L5. In the rubbing in Shastri's book several characters are indistinct in l5 (the transcript would be "gi(va)[#liṅgo]d[#va](ha)[#na]"), but the one in EI41 is much clearer. Even in that, li cannot be made out, but I assume the original plate shows it better and just show it as unclear.
--><!--
L5. Both S and Shri read parityaṣṭa, but there is no trace of tya in S's rubbing (either in the book or in EI). Instead, the character looks like tu without a hook, the u represented simply by an extension of the character's stem. The next character also has only this downward extension rather than a subscript ṭ. The writing is close to the bottom of the plate, but this did not prevent the engraver from writing a regularly hooked su, ri and mu around here, and only the very bottom of the hook of ri and mu are invisible in the rubbing.

There seems to be a pagination numeral 2 in the margin before line 13. This was noted by Shastri's editor in EI, but apparently not by Shastri himself, nor by Shri. There is no discernible pagination on pages 1 and 3 (though p1 is very noisy at the edge, so there may be a 1 somewhere), but there is a very clear 4 on page 4verso (not noted anywhere that I have seen), so this apparent 2 is probably a page number.

L12. Both Shri and S read pautrato so I accept their to, but I think it could also be ṇa (written without a loop), in which case we only need to supply a visarga, the omission of which seems to be a more likely error than inscribing to instead of ṇo.

L16. S reads māheśvara (this time, so does Shri), but māheśyara is clear. Though if I've been lenient about ligatures with n as the first consonant, then maybe I should just assume that subscript v-s look like subscript y-s...

L17. In mmayasaggrāma the double initial m and double g are clear. The final vowel is not. S (and Shri?) read o and delete one of the n-s in the next line. I prefer to read grāma, and understand the place name to be °grāmam, to explain the nn at the beginning of the next line. Note that initial m is occasionally doubled without any evident reason; I think I've seen this in some Vākāṭaka plates and the practice is explicitly noted by Shastri_Kawadkar_2000:138 with regard to the Miregaon plates, IN00185:6 (two instances).

The whole line is weird, and I'm not even sure we are dealing with a date here. Could this be about an astrologer named Kārttika? Unlikely.

L20. S believes (#Shastri_1975-76a:70n2) that the donee's father was an apratigrāhaka upādhyāya, a "non-acceptor of donations", and says that his name was left out by accident but we learn from the Mandhal grant of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa, year 2 (IN00189:20) that his real name was Droṇasvāmin. I don't find this apratigrāhaka thing convincing; the word pratigrāhaka would be logical somewhere around here, though it's very awkward in this particular spot, and the a cannot be dismissed.

L22. Shastri reads the name as ājñākabhaṭṭārikā. Shrimali reads ājjhika-bhaṭṭārikā. Looking at specimens in Indoskript, the problematic ligature is probably jjh, and the vowel seems to be ā, not i (though the top horizontal stroke is funny, seeming to consist of two curves instead of one straight line; and there is something that looks like an apostrophe before the character, which may be the tail of an otherwise lost i). [However, compare jñā in l24 and jña and jñā in l25 - both have the upper curves and both also have the upturning instead of downturning stroke in the subscript character, so maybe it is jñā after all? also, the vowel mark of jñā curves back over the top, so it's almost certain we don't have i here] #Shastri_1975-76a:72 argues that this Narindarāja cannot be the (future) Narendrasena, because "had Ājñākabhaṭṭārikā been the chief queen, she would not have been referred to simply as mother of Narēndrarāja." Later he seems to have changed his mind, and #Shastri_1997:186 says "Narendra Sena ... is probably identical with Narindarāja, born of Ājñākabhaṭṭarikā(sic) known from the recently doscovered Māṇḍhal̥ plates of Pravara Sena II." I wonder though. The Balaghat plates of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II (IN00175:31) says Narendrasena's wife (the mother of Pr̥thivīṣeṇa II) was an Ajjhitabhaṭṭārikā [there is also a queen of this name in the Uccakalpa genealogies, probably not related but who knows.] This is similar enough to the ājjhāka (or ājjhika) that we read here [and the reading should also be rechecked in that plate]. [IN00189:21 has ajjhikabhaṭṭārikā as the mother of PTHSII] Now add to this the fact that we don't actually have jananyā here, just nanyā, and the na is actually unclear. Could it be that we should emend to narinda-rāja-patnyā? (The unclear na is definitely not pa, but once we're emending, we might as well think it was meant for pa.) Narinda may well have married the lady before his coronation.
