            <p>We have seen above how, while making grants of land, the donor often emphasized the
                virtue of giving such gifts, especially to Brāhmaṇas, and the sacred nature of
                rent-free holdings created by past rulers, by inserting one or more benedictory and
                minatory verses in the deeds of grant. The stanzas generally extoll the donor of
                gifts and affirm the merit accruing to those who respect the inviolability of grants
                made by others and denounce the inequity of those who deprive donees of the gift
                land, and declare the punishment which awaits those who resume such gifts. The
                verses are sometimes also quoted in connection with the sale of land since there was
                a tendency to represent a sale of land also as a gift by a sort of popular
                    fiction.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p>
            <p>The verses are sometimes quoted without any introduction<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and often without any reference to the source, merely introducing them
                by a passage like uktañ=ca, "It has also been</p>

                Vol. VI, pp. 775 ff. ; S. Lévi, Le Nepal, III, pp. 122 ff.; P. V. Kane, History of
                Dharmaśāstra, Vol. II, pp. 1271 ff G.H. Khare quotes, without references, a large
                number of stanzas in his Marāṭhī work Saṁśodhakācā Mitra, pp. 20-37. But many of the
                verses quoted by him have nothing to do with gift of land and are apparently not
                quotations from ancient works. By way of illustration, we may refer to the stanza
                Karma ṇā manasā vācā, etc. (p.24), quoted from the charters of Harṣavardhana (cf.
                Ep. Ind., Vol. IV, p. 211, text lines 13-14) and the two verses <seg

                Prakrit and the quotation has not been referred to any source. For such verses in an

            <note>2. Vyāsa is mentioned in a large number of early inscriptions such as those of the
                Traikūṭakas, Maitrakas, Parivrājakas, Uccakalpiyas, Śarabhapurīyas, Pāṇḍuvaṁśīs,
                Early Cālukyas, Gunjaras of Nāndīpurī, Vākāṭakas and others (Lévi, op. cit., pp.
                130-31).</note>
            <note>3. See, e.g., the inscriptions of Jayanātha and Sarvanātha of Uccakalpa (CII, Vol.
                III, p. 119, text line 13; p. 122, text line 15; p. 127, text line 22).</note>
            <note>4. The section is in the form of a dialogue between Bhīṣma and Yudhiṣṭhira, while
                it contains smaller dialogues such as that between Bṛhaspati and Indra. A large
                number of stanzas from this section are quoted by Hemādri in the Dānakhaṇḍa (of his
                Caturvargacintāmaṇi), Banaras, Vol. II, pp. 477 ff. Some scholars think that the
                stanzas quoted in inscriptions belonged to a recension of the Mahābhārata, which is
                now lost (IHQ‚, Vol. III, p. 432). The Itihāsasamuccaya (cf. XIX, 38-39, 44, 52),
                stated to have been composed in verses taken from the Mahābhārata, has some of these
                stanzas (IHQ. Vol. VI. p. 777).</note>
            <note>5. See, e. g„ Ind. Ant., Vol. VI, p. 29, text line 13; Ep. Ind., Vol. VI, p. 18,

                    mah-arṣayaḥ</seg> ). For an explanation of Manu’s mention, see IHQ, Vol. VI, pp
                777-78. Sometimes people were not quite confident and ascribed the stanzas to both
                Manu and Vyāsa; cf. Manui-Vyāsa-gitau ślokau in Ep.lnd., Vol. XXVIII, p. 179, text
                line 14. See No. 164.</note>
            <note>6. Ep. Ind., Vol III. p. 146; Vol. VIII. p. 235, 240; etc. It is difficult
                sometimes to say whether Brahman is the god of that name or the word means the
                Brāhmaṇa class (i. e. the sages) or a Brāhmaṇa par excellence.</note>
            <note>7. Ibid., Vol. III, p. 146; Vol. XXII. p. 95, text lines 12-13. In medieval
                records, the grant is sometimes stated to have been made according to the
                recommendations of Bṛhaspati (ibid., Vol. XXVIII, p. 245).</note>
            <note>8. See, e‚ g., ibid., Vol. XXIV, p. 303, text line 23; Gauḍalekhamālā, p. 36. See
                also Ep. Ind., Vol. II, p. 219, where some of the stanzas are represented as the
                sayings of the sages Parāśara, Vatsa, Kutsa, Āṅgirasa, Gautama, Manu and
                Yājñavalkya.</note>
            <note>9. See, e. g,, Ep. Ind., Vol. III, p. 45; p. 268, text line 40. Out of the stanzas

            </p>
            <p>The subject of gifts of all kinds is dealt with more or less elaborately in the epics
                and the Purāṇas<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> as well as in the Dharmaśāstras.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p>
            <p>Since the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas, both of which are regarded as Dharmaśāstra,
                are ascribed to the authorship of the sage Vyāsa, it is interesting to note that
                some of the imprecatory and benedictory stanzas generally quoted in the copper-plate
                grants have been traced to the said sources and also that some of these charters
                specifically mention Vyāsa as the author of the verses. Thus some records introduce
                a few of the stanzas with the wordsVyāsa-gītā ṁś=c=ātra ślokān= udāharanti, <hi rend="superscript">4</hi> while others have uktaṁ ca bhagavatā paramar<hi

                ibid., Vol. XXXI, p. 248, text lines 35, 38, and to Purāṇa, see ibid., Vol. II, p.
                360, text line 17; Vol. III, p. 68. Ep. Ca<seg rend="color(FF0000)">m., Vol.
                </seg>XII. Si. No. 95 speaks of Itihāsa-Purā ṇa and quotes from Rāma, Āditya and
                Bṛhaspati. A particular verse (No. 117‚ Sāmānyo = 'yaṁ. etc.), found in the Skanda
                Puraṇa in a story associated with Rāma is sometimes attributed to him (Ep. Ind.,
                Vol. XXXII, p. 55, text line 42; Skanda Purāṇa, Brahma–Khaṇḍa Dharmāraṇyakhaṇḍa, Ch.
                34, verse 40). In a few cases, it is wrongly ascribed to Vālmīki, the author of the
                Rāmāyaṇa (cf. Ep. Cam., Md. No. 113). Similarly, the stanza Bahubhir=vasudhā, etc. (
                No. 23) is sometimes ascribed to Rāma (Ep. Cam., Vol. XII, Si. No. 95). Certain
                medieval records speak of attainment of the fruits of making grants of land as
                described in the Śiva Purāṇa (N. G. Majumdar, Ins. Beng., Vol. III, p. 137, text

                As will be seen below, some of the stanzas are found in theMahābhārata and the
                Purāṇas. The fact that all the stanzas specifically attributed to theMahābhārata
                cannot be traced in the present texts of the work may be due to the confusion of the
                scribes or to the loss of the version that contained the verses. The second
                alternative is not improbable since some verses assigned to the Mahābhārata by
                Hemādri in the thirteenth century cannot be traced in the available versions.</p>
            <p>The few stanzas ascribed to Vyāsa or his Mahābhārata in the earlier records were
                later quoted often along with various additional verses which were assigned to Vyāsa
                or any of the other sources referred to above.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The
                introduction of Bṛhaspati as the author of the verses is easily explained by the
                fact that theMahābhārata puts some of the stanzas in Bṛhaspati’s advice to Indra<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> and that they are also found in the B<hi
                    rend="italic">ṛhaspatisa</hi>ṁhitā. This double authorship ascribed to some of
                the stanzas gradually led to further confusion. It seems that the word 'sage' as the
                author of the stanzas, which was originally intended for Vyāsa or Bṛhaspati or both
                of them, was later confused with a sage in general and therefore sometimes used in
                the plural. This may have also been due to the fact that some of the verses are
                found in works ascribed to various sages. Similarly, the expressionDharmaśāstra,
                originally intended for theMahābhārata or the Purāṇas or a work of Bṛhaspati, was
                later confused with theMānava-Dharmaśāstra and, as a result, the sage Manu was
                confused with the author of the stanzas in question. It is not impossible that the
                earlier inscriptions influenced the later compilations of the</p>
            <note>1. Ibid„ p. 137. As has been noticed by scholars, the epithet śatasāhasrī saṁhitā
                applied to the Mahābhārata refers to the large text such as we have it today.</note>
            <note>2. In a few cases, the verses are separately ascribed to Vyāsa and to the old
                sages (Ep. Ind., Vol. XXV, p. 60, line 51; p. 62, line 79; p. 63, line 86).</note>

                section of the medieval inscriptions.<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p>
            <p>While many records quote only one or a few of the stanzas, certain medieval charters
                quote 20 or more verses.<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> The most frequently quoted
                stanzas are the two in the Anuṣṭubh metre, viz.,Bahubhir=vasudhā bhuktā, etc. (No.
                23) and Ṣa<hi rend="italic">ṣ</hi>tiṁvar<hi rend="italic">ṣ</hi>a-sahasrā<seg
                    rend="italic">ṇi</seg>(No. 123), though they are often quoted with the addition
                of one or more of the other verses. The two stanzas beginning withSva-dattāṁ
                para-dattāṁ vā(Nos. 131-32) in the same metre are equally popular, though they are
                not generally found together in the earlier epigraphs. Most of the other verses are
                also in Anuṣṭubh. Among these, some are found in the records of different parts of
                India, while some occur occasionally in those of a particular area. Certain royal
                families (e. g. the Imperial Gaṅgas of Orissa) generally favoured a group of
                stanzas, a few of which are not usually met with elsewhere. The stanzas such as Nos.
                30(Bhūmipradā, etc.) and 99 (Niśamya doṣaṁ, etc.) and others like Nos. 80-81(K<hi
                    rend="italic">ṣ</hi>udra-paśv-anṛte, etc.; Hanti jātān, etc.) are rarely quoted.
                Sometimes verses quoted from works other than the Dharmaśāstras are also noticed.
                Thus No. 88 (Madhu-Kaiṭabha°, etc.) is quoted from Murāri's Anargharāghava in an
                inscription of 1521 A. D. There are many other stanzas of this nature, which do not
                appear to be quotations, but were probably composed by the court poets of the
                donors, who were responsible for drafting the documents.<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> This seems</p>

            <p><pb n="176"/>The following stanzas, quoted from epigraphic records and arranged
                alphabetically, may be divided primarily into two groups, viz. (1) those extolling

                those made in favour of the Brāhmaṇas, and (2) those denouncing the resumption of
                gift land in the possession of Brāhmaṇas in particular. Some of the stanzas have
                been quoted after removing the linguistic and metrical errors in their texts as

                XXII. p. 161, text line 22) dīyate ca punaḥ punaḥ (ibid., Vol. XX, p. 159) in the
                first half which sometimes also reads as Manu-prabhṛtibhir=mānyair=bhuktā yady=api
                rājabhiḥ (ibid., Vol. XXVIII, p. 75, text lines 11 –12). For pārthivaiḥ instead of
                rājabhiḥ, see Ind. Ant., Vol. XII, p. 267. The stanza occurs in the PadmaPurāṇa, VI,
                33, 26-27; BhaviṣyaPurāṇa, IV, 164, 22 (with bhuktā, for dattā); SkandaPurāṇa, op.
                cit., verse 25 (with rājabhiḥ pṛthivi tv=iyam);Bṛhaspatisaṁhitā, verse 26; also
                Vṛddha-Gautama, according to Aparārka, op. cit., p. 541. Ballāla (op. cit., pp.
                316-17) attributes the stanza(with dattā for bhuktā) to the Dāna-Bṛhaspati. Cf. two
                analogous stanzas : Yas=tu pālayate bhūmiṁ bhūmipālas=tath=etaraḥ | sa dātuḥ
