              <p>Halantas. Final M (e.g. l3, l8) is a small circle with a hook on top (a stylised, reduced ma) with a slightly sinuous vertical tail. Final N (e.g. l9) is a reduced na with a slightly sinuous tail on the right-hand side of the stem. Final T (e.g. l17) is likewise a reduced ta with a tail attached on the right.</p>
              <p>Original punctuation marks are plain verticals.</p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is normally at head height after the character to which it belongs; occasionally atop the next character, e.g. l19 aṁbhodhi; l28 velaṁbaṟṟu. Initial O occurs in line 1; initial Ī in l31.
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet.

              <note>I see neither an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign> nor a punctuation mark here; the dot beyond the top right corner of <foreign>ta</foreign> appears to be damage. The <foreign>o</foreign> in <foreign>jyeṣṭho</foreign> is uncertain; only the right-hand stroke for <foreign>ā</foreign> is clear. If what seems to be a second stroke attached to the body on the left is only damage, I would still emend to <foreign>o</foreign>. For the first word, NV's <foreign>taṁ</foreign> would also be acceptable, but unless this can be confirmed as the actual reading, I prefer to assume that <foreign>jy</foreign> was written instead of <foreign>jjy</foreign> rather than to supply an <foreign>anusvāra</foreign>, because while <foreign>taj-jyeṣṭha</foreign> clearly implies an elder brother, mere <foreign>jyeṣṭha</foreign> is never used in such a sense in any related grant that I am aware of. In principle, emending to <foreign>tajjyeṣṭhānujas tam</foreign> or <foreign>tasya jyeṣṭhānujas tam</foreign> would also be possible, but there seems to be a quarter <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> here; see also the commentary. Finally, assuming that the <foreign>m</foreign> in <foreign>anujam</foreign> is a result of non-standard sandhi, emending to <foreign>taṁ jyeṣṭho ’nuja</foreign> or <foreign>taṁ jyeṣṭhānuja</foreign> would also be possible, but slightly inferior to the emendation proposed here.</note>

        <p>The genealogy seems to contain several <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign> fragments. Since these are phrases that deviate from the usual form of the prose genealogy, I do not think they are accidental; rather, they were probably lifted verbatim from a version of the genealogy composed fully in <foreign>anuṣṭubh</foreign>. Such fragments include <foreign>taj-jyeṣṭho ’nujam uccāṭya</foreign> (l9-10; see also the apparatus); <foreign>sva-yuddha-jaya-saṁkhyānāṁ</foreign> (l12); <foreign>nāka-lokālayaṁ yayau</foreign> (l16).</p>
        <p>Although according to NV, the grant <q>does not mention anything of historical interest not known from other sources,</q> stanza 1 says Amma’s mother was Lokamahādevī. This is the name of Amma II’s mother, but I am not aware of Amma I’s mother having the same name. Either this is new historical information, or perhaps the grant in fact belongs to Amma II and omits by mistake the kings from Amma I to Bhīma II. The <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00087.xml">Pulivaṟṟu (spurious?) grant of Amma I</ref> records Amma I’s mother’s name as Pallava Mahādevī, but the authenticity of that grant is questionable, and even if the information is authentic, she may have been Lokamahādevī of the Pallava dynasty.</p>
