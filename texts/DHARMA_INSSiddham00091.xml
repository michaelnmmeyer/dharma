This is not explicitly stated anywhere I've read, but I assume that these double plates, each inscribed on one face only, use 1verso and 2 recto, with the blank side of each plate facing outward.

The mangala symbol (transcribed by Pandey as Oṁ) looks like a question mark without a dot. There were no mangala symbols in other Hastin charters - but maybe check back to see if there are traces?
--><!--
The punctuation symbol is a single horizontal dash.
--><!--
Pandey reads śataika, emending to śataike. The ai mātrā is far from clear and the ka is very faint; I think it may have been deleted by beating or rubbing out, perhaps correcting an initial śataka to śate.

Pandey reads kulopannena correcting to tp. I think the t is probably there, but quite small, a bit damaged, and a bit obscured by the o mātrā in lo.

The list contains separator signs after almost all names. These were completely ignored by Pandey. Here I use a daṇḍa to transcribe them, but most of these are shorter than the punctuation dash in l1, some are just a dot.

The name that Pandey tentatively reads as rohaśarmma looks more like śāhaśarmma to me. Perhaps it could also be gāhaśarmma, as a mistake for guhaśarmma or grahaśarmma?
--><lb n="10"/>devāḍhya<unclear>|</unclear> dattaśarmma| manoratha| Agnidatta<unclear>| go</unclear>śarmma| rudrabhava| dai<unclear>ra</unclear><!--
Pandey takes devāḍhyadattaśarmma as a single name. This goes contrary to my intuition; also, I think there is a punctuation mark after ḍhya.
--><!--
Pandey reads ...tī... śarmma after agnidatta. I'm pretty certain his tī is in fact go; there are two smudged verticals (looking like ra-s) before and after it, which must correspond to Pandey's ...-s, but which may be just scratches or deleted characters since they are spaced much more closely than most of the inscription. Alternatively, I can imagine gauriśarmma or gaurīśarmma.
--><!--
Pandey reads rudradatta for my rudrabhava.
--><!--
Pandey does not report the last two characters of l10, not even as illegible.

Pandey reads the beginning of the line as ...maunaviṣṇusvāmi. The vowel is o, not au; the consonant may be m or y. There is almost certainly a punctuation mark after it.
--><!--
After viṣṇusvāmi, punar api is Pandey's reading. The characters are very badly smudged; the reading is plausible, but I'd expect another name here not such a useless word.
--><!--
The part after svāti is my attempt to make sense of a hard-to-read passage. Pandey takes svātigaṅga as one name (ignoring the punctuation mark), then reads ghoṣādyānamadhūkagavā bhagavaka sapallika vothikāpallikasamatetāgrahārotsr̥ṣṭaḥ. He emends vothikā to vīthikā and samate to sameta and sas the assets of the village granted included ghoṣa, cattle-pound; udyāna, garden; madhūka, mahua trees; palli, hamlets and vīthikā, roads. Pandey's editor (Pandey_1949-50:266n1) proposes to read (from l12) garttikā-bhagavad-visṇu-pallikā-godhikā-pallika-samavetāgrahāro tisr̥ṣṭaḥ (emending to viṣṇu, godhikāpallikā and to samaveto). I think it's acceptable to construe madhūkagarttikā as the feminine subject, then use atisr̥ṣṭaḥ in the masculine because of the proximity of āgrahāro. I also think using pallika (in both instances, not just the second) in compound is acceptable usage to which I think I've seen parallels in other parivrājaka and/or uccakalpa grants (with other feminine nouns). The most problematic of my readings are: 1. °ādyānāṁ, where "nāṁ" actually looks like tta or nta, but we sorely need a genitive or dative at the end of the list of names, so perhaps this was the intended meaning; and 2. the name of the village beginning with bhagava, followed by a ligature that could be just about anything, then s (or m) which may (as Pandey's editor thinks) indeed have another consonant below it, though if there is one, it's more likely t or th than ṇ.

The visarga after samadhūka in fact looks like a smudged r. It may perhaps be a visarga with a punctuation dash between the dots.
--></p>
          <p>yat<unclear cert="low">rāghāṭā</unclear><supplied reason="omitted">ḥ</supplied><!--
Yatrāghāṭāḥ is Pandey's editor's reading. It is very unclear, but sounds plausible.

Pandey reads siṁhānakaḥ. I see no clear anusvāra and definitely no ā mātrā.
--><lb n="15"/>pūrvveṇa vaṭāb<unclear>āhi</unclear>kā|| kinnāṭa-dehikau ca<supplied reason="subaudible">.</supplied> dakṣiṇa-pūrvveṇa Āmra-gartta-madhūka-ga<!--
The punctuation mark after vaṭabāhikā is a short double horizontal, to my eye wholly identical to the marks in l22 and l24. A puntuation mark doesn't seem to have a real function here and it has been read as a visarga by Pandey, but then again, a visarga doesn't seem proper either. So probably this is meant to be a list separator.

The halanta T is a reduced subscript form, reduced to an indiscernible blotch.

The seal inscription is upside down in relation to the rest of the text. It is at the bottom edge of the plate, about 1/4 of the length of the plate from the left edge. The text is enclosed in an oval, which is stamped on a horizontal line near the bottom margin, extending from near the left edge from near the right edge except where obliterated by the seal. This may be an incised line or perhaps the thickening at the edge of the plate is wider here and has a sharp, stepped edge.
