              <p>KR does not describe the original punctuation marks. This edition prints | and || as shown in KR's edition.</p>
              <p>Other palaeographic observations, summarised from Krishna Rao. The writing is very neat and beautiful, but with innumerable mistakes. Anusvāra is frequently omitted or added superfluously. There are two forms of ja, an open square form (l5, 10) and a later cursive form (l6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The scribe makes a distinction between da and ḍa, notable in l45 where the two are side by side.
                      
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question.

              <note>KR prints the supplied characters in square brackets with an asterisk. If I am correct in assuming that no characters are present here in the original, then I have strong reservations about supplying all this and prefer the much simpler emendation I propose here. However, I am not sure of my understanding of the text (see the translation). Given that KR's summary speaks about Vijayāditya II “destroying the Gāṅga race root and branch like a fierce wind,” probably referring to this locus, I believe KR too did not understand this passage clearly. Ideally, I would expect another comparison with <foreign>iva</foreign> here; given <foreign>māruta</foreign>, the object of such a comparison might be Indra; but this also presupposes a major scribal omission. Unless perhaps we have a single long comparison here, and <foreign>mahā-vratin</foreign> above means Rudra.</note>

A later descendant of Niravadya was named Bhaṭṭa-mahākāla (<ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00027.xml">Cevuru plates of Amma I</ref>), so the name does occur in the family.

The Sanskrit is almost as hard to parse as the translation, but I am certain it is to be understood along these lines. The term <foreign>yama-sura</foreign> is unusual, but given the context, it must in my opinion mean the god Dharma. In the third quarter, the Son of the Sun is in all probability Karṇa, famed for his selflessness. I do not, however, know how he could be selfless through his lord’s power. The poet’s implication may be that Karṇa could afford to be magnanimous because Duryodhana gave him lordship over Aṅga, but Karṇa’s famous act of generosity is giving away his innate armour and ear pendants, which has nothing to do with this lordship. Could the text perhaps read <foreign>pituḥ</foreign> instead of <foreign>pati-</foreign>, or should it be emended to that?

        <p>KR's editorial notation is inconsistent. He appears to use both square brackets and round parentheses for unclear, and brackets or parentheses with an asterisk for text supplied by the editor. But collation with a facsimile would be essential to improve the fidelity of the edition.</p>
        <p n="6" rend="stanza">Stanza 6 is in a metre that I could not trace to any established Sanskrit or Telugu metre. The prosodic pattern, identical for each quarter, is six repetitions of –⏑⏑⏑ (first paean), followed by a long syllable. Divided into trisyllabic <foreign>gaṇa</foreign>s, the pattern is bha-ja-sa-ma-bha-ja-sa-ma-ga. There may be a caesura after the tenth syllable, accentuated by <foreign>prāsa</foreign>. In each of the first three lines, five syllables at the end of the line are identical to the beginning.</p>
        <p n="71">From the shortness of line 71 I assume that this was written in insufficient space at the bottom of the plate.</p>
        <p>KR’s discussion says that Nr̥pakāma, the donor or initiator of the grant, is a brother of Vijayāditya III born of a Haihaya princess. I see no indication of his mother in the text here. However, in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00021.xml">Koṟṟapaṟṟu grant of Vijayāditya II</ref>, also a grant to many Brahmins, the executor is Nr̥parudra, a brother of the king born of a Haihaya princess.</p>
        <p>KR observes that although the text mentions a donation to a hundred Brahmins, only 79 donees are mentioned by name. I count 78 (KR apparently counts three Bhīmaśarmans in his list, of whom Bhīmaśarman (perhaps of the Kauṇḍinya <foreign>gotra</foreign>, perhaps resident of Kārañceḍu) and Bīmaśarman (perhaps of the Parāśara <foreign>gotra</foreign>), perhaps resident of Uppuṭṭūru) are actually present on the list, but the latter appears to be counted twice by KR. He assumes that the rest of the recipients were omitted by the scribe’s or composer’s mistake, but the total number of shares allotted is exactly 100. Although the text clearly talks of a hundred Brahmins, it is nonetheless likely that a hundred shares were in fact meant.</p>
        <p>KR may be correct to assume that <foreign>gotra</foreign> names and places of residence are to be supplied from above where they are not specified. This, however, leaves the first four donees without a <foreign>gotra</foreign> name. Moreover, both the list of <foreign>gotra</foreign>s and that of names contain items that reappear one or more times in the document, so neither <foreign>gotra</foreign> nor residence is an exclusive top-level sorting factor. (Spelling differences aside, Bhāradvāja <foreign>gotra</foreign> is mentioned 5 times; Kauṇḍinya and Kauśika 4 times; Kāśyapa 3 times; Gautama, Harita and Parāśara twice. As a place of residence, Kārañceḍu, Uppuṭṭūru and Vaṁgipaṟu are mentioned 3 times and Kuṇḍuru twice). There are, on the other hand, no cases where the same <foreign>gotra</foreign> is explicitly mentioned twice for one presumable residence, nor any cases where the same residence is mentioned twice for one presumable <foreign>gotra</foreign>. If such cases occurred, that would be a strong indication against supplying the missing information from above, but lacking such cases, supplying remains possible. Perhaps the list is sorted primarily by the qualifications of the donees, which would explain why certain residences and <foreign>gotra</foreign> names recur. The lack of a <foreign>gotra</foreign> for the first four donees is, however, a problem and may be due to scribal error.</p>
