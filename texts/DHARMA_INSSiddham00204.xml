          <!-- 
L5. The punctuation mark after gauriṇā is not a simple horizontal: it starts out as a dash at midline height, but then curves down and becomes vertical, going almost as deep as the descender of ri. SI describes it as "a daṇḍa with its upper part curved towards the left" and transcribes it as a double daṇḍa, taking it as the end of stanza 4. I follow Sircar's breakdown because it matches the semantic content of the stanzas, and because the vestiges in line 11 do not seem to consitute a half-anuṣṭubh, so they are probably a prose closer.

L10. The gender of the subject seems to shift. We begin with idaṁ in l9, which SI emends to ayaṁ. Then we get khānitaṁs, of which SI keeps khānitas. (SR actually reads khānitas, without the anusvāra. A dot is very conspicuous in the rubbing.) Finally we have peyo which, however, is unclear, and the restoration jalāśayaḥ which, while very logical, is quite uncertain. Therefore I prefer not to emend the initial neuters to masculine, and actually emend the ṁs to neuter as I feel this emendation is more in line with the nature of the mistakes ttasya/stasya IN00203:8 and 9. The masculine at the end stays, pending autopsy.

L11. In the last line, SR reads * * pra ... *e * mā *ā *i * ... ... while SI reads .. .. .. prada .. .. teva mātā-pitro. Mātāpitro is quite plausible and could be the beginning of the last quarter. However, SI's dotting implies only two akṣaras illegible between prada and teva, but this is flat impossible. Even if yaḥ or whatever the last syllable of the second quarter is extends to this line, the only way to make the beginning of line 11 into quarter c of a śloka is to assume that there was some blank space before it, or that some of the vestiges between "prada" and "teva" are space fillers. As to the vestiges themselves, 1. pa is visible in the rubbing, but nothing subscribed to it. I accept pr since SR and SI agree on it. 2. The next character has a large dot above it which is probably an anusvāra, though not read as such by either editor. (I wonder if 1-2 could be puṇyaṁ or pūrvvā instead of prada.) 3. There follow probably 4 entirely illegible characters. 5. Then perhaps something with an o mātrā. 6. Then probably something narrow and vertical such as ra or ka. 7. Then Sircar's te, of which the e is certain; ne or something else may be possible; 8. Sircar's va could be a visarga or punctuation or a space.
