amwb 2021-09-24: in Kielhorn's edition, I am not sure that the simple daṇḍa and double daṇḍa in the verse part are original or not. In the verse part, there is no supplied daṇda. In the prose part, it seems that he noted original daṇdas and supplied omitted daṇḍa in line 38, 40, 43, 49, 56, 57, 58. Consequently I assume that the daṇḍa in the verse part are original but we need to check that by reading the plate.
In the prose part, there is only one double daṇḍa and I have encoded both simple and double as original. As the EDG recommends to use only one punctuation mark, if the daṇḍa are not original, think about change all of them in <supplied reason="subaudible">.</supplied>
             --><!--
amwb 2021-10-01 : first, I reproduced Kielhorn's edition in the edition part ; now I have included some of my own readings based on the facsimile ; it is necessary to change all the tag for the danda and ddanda when I check how encoding the different shapes I have encountered. In the same way, I need to check hoz encoding the M in this plate by compring the different photos I have taken. For the moment, I have not proposed any improvements of the text.

amwb : kielhorn's note: 'originally patīnāṁ seems to have been engraved'
amwb : the reading of the plate shows that there is a point over the nā but it is not the circle used in this plate to note the anusvāra; so in my opinion there is no anusvāra
argr: yes, but Kielhorn seems to have meant that the dot shape could be the result of incomplete erasure of a circle shape. Anyhow, I have added the information to the apparatus.
argr: I have just learned that bhūmīpati is an attested form besides bhūmipati, so no need to use <orig>; since we don't treat other such words for 'king' as compound, I have removed the hyphen here too (though I agree this feels like a compound)

        <p n="2" rend="stanza">As the sea is the birth-place of the blessed goddess of fortune, and the moon the source of that lustre which gladdens the universe, so Dayitaviṣṇu, bright with all learning, became the progenitor of the foremost line of kings.</p>
        <p n="3" rend="stanza">From him sprang the illustrious Vapyaṭa, who, full of piety, as far as the ocean embellished the earth with massive temples, and became famous as the destroyer of adversaries</p>
        <p n="4" rend="stanza">His son was the crest-jewel of the heads of kings, the glorious Gopāla, whom the people made take the hand of Fortune, to put an end to the practice of fishes; whose everlasting great fame the glorious mass of moonlight on a fullmoon-night seeks to rival by its whiteness in the sky.</p>
        <p n="5" rend="stanza">As Rohiṇī is the beloved of the Moon, Svāhā of the Sacrificial Fire, Śarvāṇī of Śiva, and Bhadrā of the lord of the Guhyakas; as the daughter of Puloman is of Purandara, and Lakṣmī of Mura's foe, so the illustrious Deddadevī, a daughter of the Bhadra king, became the queen of that brilliant ruler of the earth, to him a source of joy.</p>
        <p n="6" rend="stanza">From them was born the glorious Dharmapāla, whose achievements are praised by the good, a master of kings who alone is ruling the entire orb of the earth; whose progress when he is about to conquer the quarters all round, the four oceans, marked by the footprints of the arrays of his elephants that bathe on their shores, patiently permit, being no longer fosses of the earth.</p>
        <p n="7" rend="stanza">When, with his ponderous army marching with unbounded glee, he proceeds to conquer the regions, and when the earth thereby slides down as if the mountains on it were marching, Śeṣa hurriedly follows him, always exactly beneath him, with his arms raised to support the circle of his heads, hurt by the jewels that sink into them, bent down by the weight.</p>

        <p n="9" rend="stanza">The fire of his wrath, stirred up when he finds himself opposed, like the submarine fire, blazes up unceasingly, checked <supplied reason="subaudible">only</supplied> by the four oceans.</p>

        <p n="10" rend="stanza">Desirous, as it were, of seeing collected together in one place such kings of old as Pr̥thu, Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, and Nala, the Creator in this Kali-age set up the glorious Dharmapāla, who has humbled the great conceit of all rulers, as a mighty post to which to fasten that elephant — the fickle goddess of fortune.</p>
        <p n="11" rend="stanza">For those armies of his,- not seeing at once how large they are, because the ten regions are whitened by the dust of their van-guard, the great Indra, afraid of what might happen to the armies of Māndhātr̥, exhausts himself in conjectures,- for them even, thrilled as they are with eagerness to fight, there is no chance of rendering assistance to his arms, which <supplied reason="subaudible">alone</supplied> annihilate the whole host of his adversaries.</p>
        <p n="12" rend="stanza">With a sign of his gracefully moved eye-brows he installed the illustrious king of Kanyākubja, who readily was accepted by the Bhoja, Matsya, Madra, Kuru, Yadu, Yavana, Avanti, Gandhāra and Kīra kings, bowing down respectfully with their diadems trembling, and for whom his own golden coronation jar was lifted up by the delighted elders of Pañcāla.</p>

        <p n="13" rend="stanza">Hearing his praises sung by the cowherds on the borders, by the foresters in the forests, by the villagers on the outskirts of villages, by the playing groups of children in every courtyard, in every market by the guardians of the weights, and in pleasure-houses by the parrots in the cages, he always bashfully turns aside and bows down his face.</p>

Daniel: "my first intuition would be that the līlā-veśman is not a brothel but e.g. a garden gazebo or suchlike."
Csaba D.: "līlāveśman is perhaps a synonym of līlāgāra / līlāgṛha / līlāgeha, and I would also think it is a pavilion or belvedere in a garden where all sorts of pleasurable activities can take place."
