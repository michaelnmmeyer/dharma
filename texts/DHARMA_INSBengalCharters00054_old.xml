"The ā mātrā at the end of l3 is far from clear. If it's ṇā, then we expect brāhmaṇāya, so the name of the donee is probably just one akṣara plus svāmin. Perhaps more probably, we have just brāhmaṇa, and then a two-syllable name."
argr adds: On inspection of the RTI, and presuming that my new reading adhikaraṇaM is the correct reading in line 1, then I find that there can be no serious doubt about the reading ṇa here, even if the akṣara as a whole is not as clear as it could be. That said, I don't find daba's argument about a hypothetical reading with -ṇā incontrovertible. In the Gaya plate there is vrāhmaṇagopadevasvāmine.
