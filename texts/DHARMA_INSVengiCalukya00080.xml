              <summary>
                <p>Halantas. A potential final M in l25 dattaM looks like a modern Bengali anusvāra (a small circle and a slanted stroke below it), while another in line 43 appears to be just a small circle, possibly with a slanted line above and to the right of it. Both of these may simply be large anusvāras with some superfluous strokes or damage. Final D in line 39 (if correctly read) is a da with a sinuous tail resembling a repha.</p>
                <p>Original punctuation marks. </p>
                <p>Other palaeographic observations. Anusvāra is above or, mostly when constrained by space, to the right of the character to which it belongs, but it may also be at median height to the right (l14, saṁghānvaye). Dependent au is clearly distinguished from o (e.g. l2 kauśikī), but o is also used in place of au (e.g. l6 potraḥ).
                      <!-- The script name(s) will be inserted here at a later stage from the metadata spreasheet. At this stage, you can mention here in a free-text paragraph any characteristics of the writing observed more than once in this inscription that seem unusual/uncommon or otherwise noteworthy given the general characteristics of the script in question. See EG 11.2. --></p>

              <handNote xml:id="VengiCalukya00080_hand1">This is the hand responsible for most of the document with large, slightly clumsily formed characters and slightly uneven lines.</handNote>
              <handNote xml:id="VengiCalukya00080_hand2">The secondary hand, possibly of the same scribe in more haste, is responsible for the last three lines. Here, the ductus and line arrangement is more uneven, and the characters are smaller (especially compared to the first three lines on the last page, which are large and widely spaced characters, as if the scribe had attempted to fill as much of the sheet with writing as possible).</handNote>

              <note>The second <foreign>ra</foreign> could indeed be <foreign>Ī</foreign> (though not <foreign>I</foreign>) if the pair of dots on its two sides are not accidental. There is a similar dot only on the left-hand side of the first <foreign>ra</foreign>, so I prefer to believe that here too, the two dots are not part of the script. See line 37 for a definite <foreign>Ī</foreign>. The subscript component of the second conjunct with <foreign>ś</foreign> is wider and more squarish than that of the first, so I believe the first is <foreign>v</foreign>, while the second is <foreign>c</foreign>. R completely ignores <foreign>plya</foreign>, the last character in the line. All my emendations here are only tentative suggestions. My thanks to Jens Thomas, who suggested (personal communication) that the superfluous subscript <foreign>l</foreign> of <foreign>plya</foreign> might have been inscribed instead of a subscript <foreign>l</foreign> on the preceding character.</note>

              <note>The first character looks like a figure 3 rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, while I would expect initial <foreign>I</foreign> to be this shape with two dots below (compare line 36). It is patently not <foreign>na</foreign>; Ramesam may have intended <foreign>ṇa</foreign> for his reading, but that is also out of the question.

        <p>According to Ramesam, the set consists of four plates strung on a ring, and his facsimiles are published with labels from 1 recto to 4 verso. This would mean that each of the four plates is inscribed on both faces. However, according to the ARIE report, the plates are five in number, and there is no remark in the report to the effect that the last plate is blank, or that the first plate is inscribed on both faces. Therefore, I assume that this is a regular set of five, with the outer faces (viz. 1 recto and 5 verso) blank. Thus, the plate I label 1 verso corresponds to that labelled 1 recto by R.</p>
        <p>To the best of my knowledge, all previous scholars who have written about this grant regarded the string <foreign>svādita</foreign> in line 11 to be a chronogram expressed in the <foreign>kaṭapayādi</foreign> notation. While the word does precede the specification of a day of the year (with month, <foreign>pakṣa</foreign> and <foreign>tithi</foreign>), and may thus be expected to identify a year, identifying it as a chronogram is problematic on several levels.</p>
        <p>First, this interpretation (read right to left) yields the number 684, which, if taken as a Śaka year, would be equivalent to ca. 761 CE, later than the end of Viṣṇuvardhana III’s reign. To eliminate this difficulty, B. V. Krishna Rao (<bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:KrishnaRao1934-1935_01"/>
            <citedRange>22</citedRange>
          </bibl>, <bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:KrishnaRao1973_01"/>
            <citedRange>35</citedRange>
          </bibl>) suggested emending the text to <foreign>svāḍhita</foreign>, yielding 644 Śaka or 721 CE, which falls within Viṣṇuvardhana III’s reign. However, the reading is clear, and Krishna Rao did not address the issue that such a chronogram is expected to be an intelligible word that is in some way relevant to the context. This could be argued for the received reading <foreign>svādita</foreign>, but is absolutely not the case with his propsed <foreign>svāḍhita</foreign>. Ramesam (<bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:Ramesam1945-1946_01"/>
            <citedRange>45-47</citedRange>
          </bibl>) argued for a date in the Vikrama era, yielding 627 CE, a date that falls in the reign of Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana. This is consistent with his claim that the grant is a re-issue of a grant from Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana’s time, but as I shall show, this is not very likely. Moreover, his arguments for the plausibility of a Vikrama date at this time and place are unconvincing.</p>
        <p>Second, even if the discrepancy of the date could somehow be eliminated, it is not likely that a chronogram of this kind would have been used without making it explicit that it refers to the year (e.g. by adding <foreign>saṁvatsare</foreign> or <foreign>śakābde</foreign>). According to Burnell (<bibl rend="omitname">
            <ptr target="bib:Burnell1878_01"/>
            <citedRange>79</citedRange>
          </bibl>), the <foreign>kaṭapayādi</foreign> system is used <q>almost exclusively in Malabar, Travancore and the southern Tamil country</q>, and moreover, it <q>was commonly in use in the fifteenth century, but, apparently, not long before then</q>. Burnell may not be entirely correct in the light of evidence recovered since his time, but recent scholarship (<bibl>
            <ptr target="bib:RajeswaraSarma2012_01"/>
            <citedRange>41, 47-48</citedRange>
          </bibl>) still shows that the first positive and dateable attestation of the system is from late 7th-century Kerala. Moreover, epigraphic instances of its use are very scarce and no earlier than the 14th century; the only one known from the Telugu area was inscribed in the 16th century and is accompanied by a Telugu gloss explaining the numerical meaning. Had such a chronogram been employed in 8th-century Veṅgī, which is unlikely in itself, it would surely have been accompanied at the very least by some sort of hint to the prospective audience.</p>
        <p>It may be added that not only <foreign>kaṭapayādi</foreign> chronograms, but, as acknowledged by Ramesam, dates in any established era, are altogether absent from all known early Eastern Cālukya grants. Charters that record a month, <foreign>pakṣa</foreign> and <foreign>tithi</foreign> (or the month and a new or full moon) either refer to a regnal year (the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00012.xml">Reyūru</ref> and <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00013.xml">Koṇeki</ref> grants and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00057.xml">Peddāpurappāḍu plates (set 2)</ref> Viṣṇuvardhana II, and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00050.xml">Cendalūr Plates of Maṅgi Yuvarāja</ref>), or refrain from stating the year at all (the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00001.xml">Sātārā plates of Viṣṇuvardhana I</ref>, the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00008.xml">Niḍupaṟu grant of Jayasiṁha I</ref>, and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00015.xml">Peṇukapaṟu grant of Jayasiṁha II</ref>).</p>
        <p>In the light of these considerations, the chronogram theory should in my opinion be discarded as nothing but fancy. What then could this string mean? The word <foreign>svādita</foreign>, though meaningful, does not seem to fit the context. Given the abundance of scribal mistakes throughout the charter, emendation is warranted. Emending to <foreign>sthāpita</foreign> would assume a minimum of scribal error, but this word also does not fit the context. Entering the realm of conjecture, I believe the word we want here is most likely to be <foreign>smābhiḥ</foreign>. Although phonetically very different from <foreign>svādita</foreign>, the graphemes involved still have an overall similarity, so it is not implausible that a scribe could have engraved one instead of the other. This reconstruction would also explain the preceding <foreign>vo</foreign> which should by normal sandhi rules be <foreign>vaḥ</foreign> before a word beginning with <foreign>s</foreign>. While absence of sandhi and the dropping of a <foreign>visarga</foreign> are common in Eastern Cālukya grants, the use of the sandhi-form <foreign>-o</foreign> in place of the default <foreign>-aḥ</foreign> is not. The proposed <foreign>vo ’smābhiḥ</foreign> is, however, standard sandhi for <foreign>vaḥ</foreign> + <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign>.
The phrase <foreign>viditam astu vo ’smābhiḥ</foreign> (or <foreign>viditam astu vo yathāsmābhiḥ</foreign>) is the stock beginning of the executive part of many related grants and is especially common in this earlier period of the Eastern Cālukya dynasty. In my opinion the original function of <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> in this phrase must have been to identify the agent of the act of donation at the end of the executive section. Thus, the framework of the executive part is <foreign>viditam astu vaḥ</foreign>, “let it be known to you” that <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign>, “by us” (the king speaking in the first person and the majestic plural) something <foreign>dattaḥ</foreign>, “has been given”. However, in the legalese of copper plate charters, the syntax of the executive section does not always conform to the above pattern and may, for example, use an active rather than passive participle or even an active finite verb to express the action (which in turn would require the first person pronoun in the nominative case, not the instrumental <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign>). It also happens in some grants (the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00062.xml">Ciṁbuluru plates of Vijayāditya III</ref> and the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00031.xml">Śrīpūṇḍi grant of Tāḻa II</ref>) that the agent is expressed by a second pronoun in the instrumental case, near the verbal form expressing the action. In such cases, it seems that the drafter misconstrued <foreign>viditam astu vo ’smābhiḥ</foreign>, perhaps as “let you be informed by us,” or simply did not understand or care about the function of the first <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> and used it merely because he knew it was conventional to put that word in that place.</p>
        <p>In the present case too, we have a second <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> at the very end of the executive section, just after the predicate <foreign>dattam</foreign> (line 25). Since the person who composed the charter was clearly not a proficient Sanskrit writer, he too may well have used the first <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> just for convention’s sake or in a mistaken sense. However, if I am correct in reconstructing and interpreting the executive section, there may be another solution to the issue, discussed below.
Ramesam (p47) simply announces that in this executive section, expressed as a single sentence, the agent is Queen Ayyaṇa. While the composer did have something of a swashbuckler approach to syntax and Sanskrit declension, I find it hard to believe that the agent of a passive participle (line 25, <foreign>dattam</foreign>) should be expressed by an apparent nominative (line 22, <foreign>ayyana-mahādevi</foreign>),<note>In my discussion I use the spelling of the name with a retroflex <foreign>ṇ</foreign> as found in line 51.</note> when the above-mentioned second <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> stands right next to that participle. It is in my opinion much more likely that <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> (either the second instance of this word or both) expresses the agent, meaning the reigning king Viṣṇuvardhana III who is making this address. The name of Ayyaṇa <foreign>mahādevī</foreign> is then to be construed not as a nominative but as in compound, joined to the following compound describing the Naḍuṁbi <foreign>vasati</foreign> (with a dative ending), signifying the recipient of the grant. The “<foreign>vasati</foreign> of the queen” is probably to be understood as an establishment commissioned by that queen.</p>
        <p>Thus, contrary to the prevailing opinion that the present grant is a re-issue or confirmation of the original endowment of the <foreign>vasati</foreign> made in the time of Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana, I adduce that this is a later and additional grant made in the time of Viṣṇuvardhana III, to a temple established by Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana’s queen. I may be mistaken in this interpretation, since the colophon (lines 51-52) names Ayyaṇa <foreign>mahādevī</foreign> as <foreign>ājñapti</foreign> and (probably) says that the charter is authorised with Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana’s seal. Nonetheless, in my opinion the executive section does not at all imply the existence of an earlier grant. The discrepancy of the colophon may be explained by assuming that the less than gifted composer of this text used the founding charter as a model for the present one (compare the colophon of the 00010, which is apparently modelled on that of a Viṣṇukuṇḍin grant at the same locality). Moreover, the name Ayyaṇa is masculine. It is thus probably not the personal name of the queen concerned, but a family name.<note>The executor of the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00050.xml">Cendalūr Plates of Maṅgi Yuvarāja</ref> belongs to the <foreign>ayyaṇānvaya</foreign> and bears royal titles. In the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00070.xml">Īnteṟu grant of Bādapa</ref>, the mother of a royal favourite comes from the <foreign>jyeṣṭhāyāṇa-kula</foreign>, which may be the same family. Less certainly, the <foreign>āryāhū</foreign> (understand <foreign>āryāhva</foreign>?) lineage of a subordinate ruler (<foreign>mahārāja</foreign>) mentioned in the <ref target="DHARMA_INSVengiCalukya00053.xml">Koṇḍaṇagūru grant of Indra Bhaṭṭāraka</ref> may also be the same family.</note> If so, then both Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana and Viṣṇuvardhana III may have had wives of this lineage. The intended meaning of the garbled phrase <foreign>śāsanāṁkitaṁ kubja-viṣṇuvarddhana-mahārājasya</foreign> may also be something other than that the present grant is seald with Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana’s seal.</p>
        <p>Proceeding to the details of the grant, Ramesam altogether ignores most of lines 12-13. Indeed, much of this text is gibberish as received. However, copious but plausible emendation (for which see the apparatus to these lines) can render it meaningful and appropriate to the context. If my conjectural restoration is correct, then we have a compound in the plural instrumental agreeing with <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign>, telling us that the donor was pleased by the instruction (<foreign>ādeśa</foreign>) of the <foreign>ācārya</foreign> Kālibhadra. We also have a phrase ending in <foreign>iti</foreign>, revealing the essence of this instruction, which seems to be a prediction to the effect that the position of supreme ruler will be attained. Since Jains had a reputation for divination, it is likely that the <foreign>ācārya</foreign> in question had foretold Viṣṇuvardhana III’s rise to kingship and is now being rewarded. This king was preceded on the throne by two of his brothers, his senior Jayasiṁha II and his junior Kokkili. He must have been quite concerned over whether he would ever become king, especially during the brief reign of Kokkili. If this interpretation involving a foretelling is accepted, then the charter is unlikely to be a reissue of a grant made in Kubja Viṣṇuvardhana’s time.</p>
        <p>The phrase expressing the date comes directly before the words discussed above and may thus be part of the <foreign>iti</foreign> quotation summarising the prediction, in which case the <foreign>ācārya</foreign> has foretold not only Viṣṇuvardhana III’s accession to kingship, but also the day on which it would happen. Moreover, if the date is included in the quoted text, then going a step further would also include the first instance of <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign>. This results in a complete sentence expressing a prediction complete in itself, so I prefer this version in my translation. In this reading of the text, the minor syntactic problem of the iteration of <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign> is eliminated, since the first instance is in the quoted sentence. Simultaneously, the introductory phrase is reduced to <foreign>viditam astu vo</foreign>, which does occur in cognate grants without <foreign>asmābhiḥ</foreign>. As a corollary of this interpretation, our charter lacks not only a year, but also a day on which it was issued. This is uncommon among early Eastern Cālukya charters, but not unique and thus not a cause for concern. Read in this way, the text implies that the grant was made at, or shortly after, Viṣṇuvardhana III’s coronation, and this implicit date may be why it was not deemed necessary to record an explicit date, or the occasion on which the grant was made. That said, lacking clearer hints either way, I cannot establish whether the syntactical position of the date is as given in my translation, or whether it should be understood that the donation took place on the specified day and the prediction was simply that Viṣṇuvardhana III would become king in due course (<foreign>anvayād</foreign>).</p>
        <p>The principal donee is definitely Kālibhadrācārya, who participated in the ritual sanctification of the donation, but his relationship to the other masters mentioned in lines  14 to 17 is not clear. The interpretation reflected in my translation, involving two masters responsible for the prediction, who were (together or separately) the students of two more masters of one lineage with two previous generations of named preceptors, is in my opinion the most likely given the structure of the text. However, the syntax is garbled and the declensional endings non-standard, so different scenarios cannot be excluded.</p>
