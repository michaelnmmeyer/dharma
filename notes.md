## Scripts

Not many people use @rendition to specify scripts. I suspect it is because
they are noted with meaningless identifiers as in `rendition="class:83225
maturity:83213"`, which is unreadable. Use more meaninfgul identifiers? (they
can be mapped to the taxonomy of OpenTheso if needed).

## Language codes, the table in the appendix of the EGD.

The proper code for "Undetermined Language" is "und".

For x-oldbalinese, should submit a change request (here:
https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_changes/submitting_change_requests). Apparently,
"oba" and "obn" are free.

Language codes enumerated in the table belong to ISO 639-3, but "pra" (Prakrit
languages) belongs to ISO 639-5, it designates a family of languages. There are
also individual language codes, namely:

	pka	Ardhamāgadhī Prākrit
	pmh	Māhārāṣṭri Prākrit
	psu	Sauraseni Prākrit

Indicate in the table to use "pra" instead of these?
