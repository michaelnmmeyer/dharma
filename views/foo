display
checking uniqueness of references for addressing stuff later on. i need to know how to construct a unique number from @n of varuious elements; also dsepends on logical
difficult to construct readable refs, unreadable ones is easier


update with what i have understood so far


## gridlike

no problem for display

"gridlike milestones must always have unique numbers as far as the identification of a certain grid component is concerned"

	would be simpler for me if e say "all gridlike elements in a given line, whatever their unit, must have a unique @n within this line

several gridlike units:
	texts/DHARMA_INSEIAD00039.xml ['face', 'fragment']

i assume that people won't want to referebnce this

## linelike

no problem for display

for constructing references, i do textpart/@n + . + lb/@n. because i cannot
tell whetehr numbering is continous or not. so we might have:
A.A1, A.A2.
is amlso why i want to make the @n  isible, because it will be use in refernecing

## pagelike

for display,; ios ok as long as i can assume that all milestones are on the
same level and display them in the same font, etc. then i must not show this in the toc

people use div textpart or phys relatively interchangeabley

some examples with several pagelike units ; all units are on the same level
	texts/DHARMA_INSCIK00090.xml ['item', 'zone']
	texts/DHARMA_INSCIK00523.xml ['face', 'item']
	texts/DHARMA_INSCIK00601.xml ['column', 'face']
i am fine with this as long as everything is on the same level

we need to decide how to display this. must not be confused with the textpart headings.
for now i display differnetly pb and other mil'estones

ok for referencing
