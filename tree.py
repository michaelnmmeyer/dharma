'''XML tree representation.

Node types are: `Tree`, `Tag`, `Comment`, `String`, `Instruction`. Attributes
are not represented as nodes, even though they are treated like that in the
xpath model, because this would be weird in python.

All node types derive from an abstract base class `Node`. `Tree` and `Tag` nodes
derive from an abstract class `Branch`, which itself derives from `Node`. There
is no inheritance relationship between concrete node types. For instance,
`Comment` is not a subclass of `String`, unlike in BeautifulSoup. Thus, to check whether a
node is of a concrete given type `T`, using `isinstance(node, T)`, etc. is
sufficient. And to check whether a node is a branch or a leaf, it is sufficient
to check `isinstance(node, Branch)`.

When parsing documents and when modifying attributes, we always normalize spaces
in attributes: we replace all sequences of whitespace characters with " " and we
trim whitespace from both sides. Thus, an attribute with only whitespace is
considered empty. Furthermore, we don't make a distinction between an empty or
blank attribute and an attribute that is not explicitly given. Thus, we assume
that `<foo bar="">` and `<foo bar="  ">` are identical to `<foo>`. This is wrong, but
it doesn't cause much harm in practice, and considerably simplifies processing.
It is still possible to check whether an attribute is explicitly given by
using the Node.keys() method.

For simplicity, we do not deal with XML namespaces at all. We just remove
namespace prefixes in both elements and attributes. Thus,
`<xsl:template>` becomes `<template>`, and `<foo xml:lang="eng">` becomes `<foo
lang="eng">`. This means that we cannot deal with documents where namespaces are
significant. This also means that we cannot properly serialize XML documents
that used namespaces initially. However, the resulting simplicity trumps this
not-so-accurate processing.

We use XPath expressions for searching and matching, but only support a small
subset of it. Most notably, it is only possible to select `Tag` and `Tree`
nodes. Other types of nodes, attributes in particular, can only be used in
predicates viz. within brackets, as in `foo[@bar]`. We also do not support
expressions that index node sets in some way (because we are using generators
instead of lists for computing intermediate results). Thus, testing a node
position in a node set or evaluating the length of a node set is not possible.

There is one notable difference with XPath: the text() function does not return
strings from the tree, but returns instead a (space-normalized) string which
concatenates all string nodes under a given subtree.

For convenience, we add a few extra axes to XPath's default. They are:

* `stuck-child`.
	Returns the first child element of the current node, iff there
	is no text or just whitespace between the current node and this
	child. This only ever returns one child.
* `stuck-parent`.
	Reverse of stuck-child.
* `stuck-following-sibling`.
	Returns the first following sibling of the current node, iff there is
	no text or just whitespace between the current node and this sibling.
	This only ever returns one sibling.
* `stuck-preceding-sibling`.
	Reverse of stuck-preceding-sibling.

XPath expressions can use the following functions:

`glob(pattern[, text])`, `iglob(pattern[, text])`

Checks if `text` matches the given glob `pattern`. If `text` is not given,
it defaults to the node's text contents. `iglob` is like `glob`, but is
case-insensitive. In addition, we have:

`regex(pattern[, text])`

Like `glob`, but for regular expressions. Matching is unanchored, so `^` and
`$` must be used if the idea is to match a full string.

`name()`
`lang()`, `assigned-lang()`, inferred-lang()`
`mixed()`, `empty()`, `plain()`, `text()`

Returns the corresponding attributes in `Node`.

To evaluate an expression, we first convert it to straightforward python source
code, then compile the result, and finally run the code. Compiled expressions
are saved in a global table and are systematically reused. There is no caching
policy for now, so it is not a good idea to generate expressions on-the-fly.

The xpath.py command-line tool can be used for evaluating xpath expressions. If
it is not given any file to search into, it just prints the Python code that
will be used for evaluating the given expression.
