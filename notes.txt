## Done

* Server and deployment are OK.
* Update/validation logic and db structure and transaction logic are OK but
  not finalized, still cases I have not taken care of. The update system is
  efficient enough as is, I believe.
* idem for inscriptions display and bibliography entries. but parsing is messy
  and will need rework when doing search. Also have display bugs.

For the interface, the goal is to have catalog-like interfaces for various
objects (persons, repos, biblio, etc.), so that the user can
browse/filter/search different types of objects with the same basic interface.

## Problems

### phys struct and numbering

Milestones (phys)
Need to define an explicit structure that defines how units should nest, like:

	<page><line><zone/></line></page>

Or maybe a grammar?

Numbering of verses. Need to find a predictable pattern. Would be better if we
had readable references, but maybe won't be possible.
I will take the code from my website and adapt it. 1.5 months. Parsing and cleaning
up the data is more time-consuming, maybe 2 months at least.


### metadata ; authorities.

Not much data in tables, not sure what to do with it, unusable for now. I think
most of this stuff should be unstructured raw text, because there are
restrictions to make things searchable, and it is not possible to predict in
advance what format, etc. should be used.

In any case, the tables should be in our git repos, not on google docs, and
they should be regular CSV or TSV files, not things with colors and weird
display, because not possible to track changes and to parse them, etc.

We should use inline annotations inside the text for: scripts (@rendition),
languages (@xml:lang), persons (<persName>), places (<placeName>). bc People
don't edit their mdt tables. We will derive external table as we proceed, as for
g/@type and @xml:lang.

### unsupported files

we have Epigraphia Carnatica that does not fit any schema. if we want to
incorporate it in the db, it needs to be split into several files, for each
inscription.

stuff in tfd-nusantara-philology. all the DHARMA_DiplEd need to be made to
conform to DHARMA_INS to be incorporated into the DB; need discussion with
Daniel. They follow unwritten rules. éditions critiques d'arlo ; cf. martina?


## Calendar

2.5 years

search: 1 and a half year. Needs forethought. I need to thinksecond half
of this year, while doing other stuff. Should definitely start writing it
before 2025

Need to be reasonable for ad hoc auxiliary tasks. Axelle spent
too much time doing that. Maybe reserve 1 day a week or sth for these tasks?

### tamil lexica

I will take the code from my website and adapt it. 1.5 months. Parsing and
cleaning up the data is more time-consuming, maybe 2 months at least.

### search

Search: 1 and a half year. Needs thought. I need to think about it second half
of this year, while fixing bugs. Should definitely start writing it before 2025.
Takes longer to
write/amend than most of what I have done so far, bugs are more problematic.

### User interface

Not interactive (no autocomplete, resizable elems, etc.). Takes me much time bc
I'm not a JS specialist. At end of project?
